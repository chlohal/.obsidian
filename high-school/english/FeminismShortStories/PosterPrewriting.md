_Prompt 4 (maybe) (3 as a fallback though) (just in case)_

it's really easy to fall into a listicle format for 2/3, so i don't want to try it, sorry. i think it'd be too easy for me to go "__nurturing__ women being nurturing foo bar barbaz. Sexy blah bleh, A Temporary Matter blah bleh." and it wouldn't be a good essay :/

# The collected short stories attempt, in various ways, to critique patriarchy, but do so in a manner which inadvertantly echos patriarchal presentations of femininity.


"but all of this is ignoring how they echo patriarchal presentations of femininity *purposefully* in order to show how bad they are" -- yeah, but by presenting-- 


---

`this is tending too close to whataboutism, which is worse than a listicle by far`

---

By uniformly presenting the patriarchy as an inescapable force, these short stories portray an excessively grim image of humanity. 

---

`is that something concrete though? something that can be treated critically?`

---


it's good enough.

"If she was to mother a child, to mute and subdue and fold away parts of herself, her child had to be perfect"

"Ogechi collected herself enough to direct the girl next door, then fell into a pit of jealous tears."

Both of these emphasise how Ogechi feels a need to be a mother.

"or whispered his name on those rare occasions they still reached for each other's bodies before sleeping" -- sexual intercourse presented as a prerequisite for a healthy relationship

"It was nobody's fault, she continued. They'd been through enough"
Argue: Look! After grieving, she's not letting herself be consumed by her loss of her role as a mother/wife!
Counter-argue: the narrative focuses not on Shoba's growth, but how it affects Shukumar.

Can I afford more than 1 argue/counter? No.

"That time of motherhood is almost behind me when the ear is not one's own but must always be racked and listening for the child cry, the child call"
Shadows this whole story: the mother is writing *about* Emily. Even in sentences like these, the mother is nearly 'apologising' for her inability to take care of Emily. --point out wordings-- can't; out of quotes-- find some more

"I was nineteen"
Short quote, but it's an example of her implicitly apologising for inability to take care of Emily by offering excuses to the teacher/authority figure. By its nature, this story shows a mother who thinks she has failed in some duty by not giving a good world to her child
- oh that's gonna need analysis to prove. like a paragraph by its *self*
