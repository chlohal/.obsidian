				LAMBEAU
   Mod f(x) squared dx. So, please finish Percival, by next
   time. And I know many of you had this as
   undergraduates, but it won't hurt to brush up . . . .
   Thank you, Steven . . . . I also put an advanced Fourier
   system on the main hallway chalkboard. I'm hoping that
   one of you might prove it by the end of the semester.
   Now, the person to do so will not only be in my good
   graces, but also go on to fame and fortune by having
   their accomplishment recorded and their name printed in
   the auspicious MIT Tech. Former winners include Nobel
   Laureates, Fields Medal Winners, Renowned
   Astrophysicists, and lowly MIT professors. Well, that's
   all. If you have any questions, I'm sure that..Tom has the
   answers.

				MORGAN

				CHUCKIE
   She's missing a tooth, Will. She's got skin problems.
   Plus, it's like five to two Morgan ends up marryin' her,

   She's got a nice ass.

				MORGAN
   That's her own nice ass. (That's a real nice ass)

				BILLY
   Who's the guy she's with?

				MORGAN
   That fucking ginny. I hate that little bitch. Will knows
   him.

				WILL
   That fuckhead Carmine Scarpaglia (?). That kid used

   Double burger. . . . .double
   burger?........
		 (singing)
   Chuck, I had a double burger!

				CHUCKIE
   Would you shut the fuck up. I know what you ordered.
   I was there.

				MORGAN
   So, give me my fuckin' sandwich.

				CHUCKIE
   Whaduya mean, "your sandwich?" I bought
   it....Morgan, how much money you got on you?

				MORGAN
   I set out your change, right. Get the snowcone (?) I
   said that before, when we pulled up. Why don't you
   just give me my sandwich, and stop being a prick?

				CHUCKIE
   All right, well, give me your fucking 16 cents that you
   got on you now, and we'll put your fuckin' sandwich
   on layaway. There we go. Keep it right up here for
   ya', and we'll put you on a program. Every day you
   come in with your six cents, and at the end of the week
   you get your sandwich.

				MORGAN
   Don't be an asshole...

				CHUCKIE
   What am I? Your fuckin' sandwich welfare? I think
   you should establish a good line of credit. Like how
   you bought your couch. Payment plans. Remember?
   Your mother brought in ten dollars every day for a
   year..she finally got a couch rent-a-center style.

				MORGAN
   Can I have my food now, please?

				CHUCKIE
   Here's your fuckin' double burger.

				WILL
   Hey, hold up Chuck. Slow it down.

				CHUCKIE
   What do we got?

   fight him then, but we got snacks, now.

				LAMBEAU
   Is it just my imagination or has my class grown
   considerably? Well, by no stretch of my imagination
   do I believe you've all come here to hear me lecture.
   But rather to ascertain the identity of the mystery math
   magician. So, without further ado, come forward
   silent rogue and receive thy prize.........Well, I'm
   sorry to disappoint my spectators, but it seems there
   will be no unmasking here today. However, um...my
   colleagues and I have conferred, and there is a
   problem on the board right now that took us more
   than two years to prove. So, let this be said: the
   gauntlet has been thrown down, but the faculty have
   answered, and answered, with vigor.

   Boy, I alwayssawhowstupidyouneedtobe to get fired
   from that job. I mean, how hard is it to push a
   mother-fuckin' broom aroundaroom.

				CHUCKIE
   Bitch, you got fired from pushing a fuckin' broom.

				MORGAN
   I got fired because management was restructuring.

				BILLY
   Yeah, restructuring the amount of retards they had
   workin' for 'em.

				MORGAN
   Shut up. You get canned more than tuna, bitch.

				BILLY
   At least I got a mother-fuckin' job right now, don't I?

				MORGAN
   Yeah.

				BILLY
   Why did you get fired, Will, com'on.

				WILL
   'ell, management was restructuring.

				CHUCKIE
   My uncle could probably get you on the demo team.

				WILL
   Can he do that?

				MORGAN
   You kidding me? I asked you yesterday if I could get a

				CHUCKIE
   And I told you no, yesterday.

In Bow and Arrow Pub

   Lets sit over here...

				CHUCKIE
   This is...This is a Harvard bar, huh? I thought there'd be
   equations and shit on the walls...I will take a pitcher of
   the finest Lager in the house....Time out. I'm gunna
   hafta' bust a little move on dem Harvard honeys down at
   the end of the bar. Work some magic.......... Oh, hello.

				SKYLAR
   Oh, hello.

				CHUCKIE
   Hi, how are you?

				SKYLAR
   Fine.

				CHUCKIE
   So, do you ladies uh. . .

				SKYLAR
   Come here often?

				CHUCKIE
   Do I come here..? I come here a bit. I
   here...uh...uh...from time to time...Do you go to school
   here?

				SKYLAR
   Yup.

				CHUCKIE
   Yeah...let's see...see, I think I had a class with you.

				SKYLAR
   Oh yeah? What class?

				CHUCKIE
   History.

				SKYLAR
   Maybe.

				CHUCKIE
   Yeeesss...I think that's what it was. You don't
   necessarily...might not remember me...You know, I like
   it here. It doesn't mean cus' I go here I'm a genius...I
   am actually very smart...

				CLARK
   Hey.

				CHUCKIE
   Hey. How's it goin'? How are you?

				CLARK
   Good. How're you doin'?

				CHUCKIE
   You wanna...--

				CLARK
   What uh...What class did you..did you say that was?

				CHUCKIE AND SKYLAR
   History.

				CLARK
   Yeah...JUST History? It musta' been a survey course
   then, huh?

				CHUCKIE
   Yeah, it was, it was surveys.

				CLARK
   Right.

				CHUCKIE
   You should check it out, it's a good course. It's a,
   uh...good..good class.

				CLARK
   How'd you like that course?

				CHUCKIE
   You know...Frankly, I found the class, you know,
   rather...uh...elementary.

				CLARK
   Elementary..

				CHUCKIE
   Yeah..

				CLARK
   You know I don't doubt that it was.

				CHUCKIE
   Yeah...

				CLARK
   I uh...I remember that class. It was um...it was just
   between recess and lunch.

				SKYLAR
   Clark, why don't you go away..?

				CLARK
   Why don't you relax?

				SKYLAR
   Why don't you just go away?

				CLARK
   I'm just having fun with my new friend, that's all.

				CHUCKIE
   What, are you gunna' have a problem? I don't
   understand...

				CLARK
   No, no, no, no..no, there's no problem here. I was just
   hoping you might give me some insight into the
   evolution of the market economy of the Southern
   Colonies. My contention is that uh...prior to the
   Revolutionary War, the economic modalities, especially
   in the Southern Colonies, could most aptly be
   characterized as agrarian precapital--

				WILL
   Let me tell you somethin', all right? Of course that's
   your contention.

				CLARK
   Hang on a second.

				WILL
   You're a first year grad student. You just got finished
   reading some Marxian historian -- Pete Garrison,
   probably -- you gunna' be convinced of that till next
   month when you get to James Lemon, then you're
   gunna' be talkin' about how the economies of Virginia
   and Pennsylvania were entrepreneurial and capitalist
   way back in 1740. That's gunna' last until next year,
   you're gunna' be in here regurgitatin' Gordon Wood.
   Talkin' about, you know, the pre-Revolutionary Utopia
   and the capital forming effects of military mobilization.

				CLARK
   Well, as a matter of fact I won't because Wood
   drastically underestimates the impact of social di--

				WILL
   Wood drastically...Wood drastically underestimates the
   impact of social distinctions predicated upon wealth,
   especially inherited wealth. You got that from Vickers.
   Work in Essex County, page 98, right? Yeah, I read
   that, too. You gunna' plagiarize the whole thing for us?
   Do you have any thoughts that...of your own on this
   matter? Or do you-- is that your thing? You come into a
   bar, you read some obscure passage, and then pretend
   you, you..pawn it off as your own..as your own idea just
   to impress some girls..? Embarrass my friend? See, the
   sad thing about a guy like you is in fifty years you're
   gunna start doing some thinkin' on your own, and
   you're gunna' come up with the fact that there are two
   certainties in life: one, don't do that, and, two, you
   dropped a hundred and fifty grand on a fuckin'
   education you coulda' got for a dollar fifty in late
   charges at the public library.

				CLARK
   Yeah, but I will have a degree. and you'll be serving my
   kids fries at a drive-thru on our way to a skiing trip.

				WILL
   Yeah, maybe. eh, but at least I won't be unoriginal.
   Pardon me, if you have a problem like that, you and me
   could just outside 'n we could figure it out.

				CLARK
   No, man, there's no problem..It's cool.

				WILL
   It's cool?

				CLARK
   Yeah.

				WILL
   Cool.

				CHUCKIE
   You're fuckin' damn right it's cool. How do ya' like me
   NOW?

				MORGAN
   My boy's wicked smart... (You come to this place, you run
   into a Barney!) (later)... you know, I was
   gunna' lose that crazy deal, but then Chu...uh, Billy
   insulted one of them and the heavy-set girl said that I
   had a--have a recedin' hairline and I was a few pounds
   overweight and I was like "go fuck yourself!".........I
   swallowed a bug.

				WILL
   Hi...

				SKYLAR
   You're an idiot.

				WILL
   What?

				SKYLAR
   You're an idiot. I've been sitting over there for 45
   minutes waiting for you to come and talk to me, but I'm
   tired now and I hafta' go home, and I..I couldn't sit
   there any more waiting for you.

				WILL
   Well..I'm Will.

				SKYLAR
   Skylar.

				WILL
   Skylar.

				SKYLAR
   Oh, and by the way, that guy over there...the Michael
   Bolton clone...he wasn't singing with us, so to speak.

				WILL
   Yeah, I know. I kinda' got that impression.

				SKYLAR
   Good. Okay. Well, I've got to go. Gotta' get up early
   and waste some more money on my overpriced
   education.

				WILL
   No..I didn't mean you. I--

				SKYLAR
   Oh, that's all right. There's my number. I was hoping
   we could go out for coffee sometime.

				WILL
   All right, yeah. May-maybe we could just get together
   and eat a bunch of caramels.

				SKYLAR
   dyou--?

				WILL
   When you think about it, it's as arbitrary as drinking
   coffee.

Courtroom

				WILL
   There is a lengthy legal precedent, your honor, going
   back to 1789, whereby a defendant can claim
   self-defense against an agent of the government, if that
   act is deemed a defense against tyranny, a defense of
   liberty.

				PROSECUTOR
   Your Honor...

				WILL
   Henry Lloyd Beecher in Proverbs from the Plymouth
   Pulpit, 1887 says, and I quote--

				PROSECUTOR
   1887? This is the 20th century, your honor.

				WILL
   Excuse me. Excuse me.

				PROSECUTOR
   You're making a mockery of the court here!

				WILL
   I'm afforded the right to speak in my own defense, sir,
   by the Constitution of the United States. This is the same
   document that guarantees my liberty.

				PROSECUTOR
   Hey, don't tell me about the Constitution of the United
   States.

				WILL
   Now, liberty, in case you've forgotten, is the soul's right
   to breath. And when it cannot take a long breath, laws
   are girdered too tight. Without liberty, man is a syncope
   (sounds like sinko.)

				PROSECUTOR
   Man is a what?

				WILL
   Ibid, your honor..

				JUDGE MALONE
   Son, my turn. I've been sitting here for ten minutes now
   lookin' over this..rap sheet of yours. I just can't believe
   it. June '93, Assault. September '93, Assault. Grand theft
   auto, February '94. Where apparently you defended
   yourself and had the case thrown out by citing Free
   Property Rights of Horse and Carriage from 1798.
   Janurary '95, impersonating an officer. Mayhem. Theft.
   Resisting. All overturned. I'm also aware that you've
   been through several foster homes. The state removed
   you from three because of serious physical abuse. You
   know, another judge might care, but you hit a cop.
   You're going in. Motion to dismiss is denied. Fifty

				LAMBEAU
   I'm Gerald Lambeau, the professor you told to fuck
   himself.

				WILL
   Well, what the fuck do you want?

				LAMBEAU
   I've spoken to the judge. And he's agreed to release
   you, under my supervision.

				WILL
   Really?

				LAMBEAU
   Yeah. But under two conditions.

				WILL
   What're those?

				LAMBEAU
   The first condition is that you meet with me every week.

				WILL
   What for?

				LAMBEAU
   Well, the proof you're working on...can do some, more
   advanced...combinatory mathematics. Finite math.

				WILL
   Sounds like a real hoot.

				LAMBEAU
   And the second condition is that..that you see a therapist.
   And I'm responsible to submit reports on this....yes..and
   if you fail to meet with any of those conditions you will
   have to serve time.

				WILL
   All right, I'll do the math, but I'm not gunna meet with
   any fuckin' therapist.

				LAMBEAU
   It's better than spending that time in jail, isn't it?

				PSYCHOLOGIST
   Will, the pressures, and I'm not judging them, I'm not

				PSYCHOLOGIST
   You hide, do you?

				WILL
   No, no...I mean I like...I--I go places. I interact, you
   know?

				PSYCHOLOGIST
   Really, what sort of places?

				WILL
   Just certain clubs.

				PSYCHOLOGIST
   More. That's nice. Yes. What sort of clubs?

				WILL
   Like uh...like fantasy.

				PSYCHOLOGIST
   Fantasy? That's nice.

				WILL
   It's not bad.

				PSYCHOLOGIST
   A bit more.

				WILL
   It's just something, like, when you get in there and the

   Okay...you are in your bed, Will. Now...how old are
   you?

				WILL
   Seven.

   What do you see?

				WILL
   Someone's in my room.

				HYPNOTIST
   What is it?

				WILL
   It's like...uh...it's a figure. It's uh..hoverin' over me.

				HYPNOTIST
   You are in a safe place, Will.

				WILL
   It's tou...It's touchin' me.

				HYPNOTIST
   Where is it touching you?

				WILL
   It's touchin' me down there. ...and I'm nervous.

				HYPNOTIST
   You don't hafta' be nervous, Will.

				WILL
   We...start dancin' and dancin' and it's just beautiful.
   Cus' (sings) we can make a lot of love before the sun
   goes down. Skyrockets in flight. Afternoon delight!
   Heeeey Afternoon Delight!

				LAMBEAU
   Jesus.

				WILL
		 (singing)
   Skyrockets in flight, duh, duh, duh, duh. oh come on,
   let's dance.


				LAMBEAU
   I'm sorry, Rich

				HYPNOTIST
   I have better things to do with my time.

				WILL
		 (singing)
   Heeeey, Afternoon Delight! Com'on, one dance!
   You--you really hypnotized me, you know.

				LAMBEAU
   For God's sake, Will.

				WILL
   Whaat? Oh com'on. I--he left! You can't pin that on me.

				LAMBEAU
   I told you to cooperate with these people.

				WILL
   Look..into my eyes...

				LAMBEAU
   Get out, Will.

				WILL
   I don't need theeerapyyyyy...

				LAMBEAU
   That's enough! Get out!

				WILL
   Aaaaaaaaaaa.... 

				TOM
   I called Mel Linedrove this morning to see if he was
   avail--

				LAMBEAU
   Oh, what's the use?

				TOM
   Whadoyou wanna' do?

				LAMBEAU
   Well, there is someone.

				TOM
   Who is he?

				LAMBEAU
   He used to be my, um, my roommate in college.

Bunker Hill Community College Classroom

				SEAN
   Trust...very important..in a relationship, it's also very
   important in a clinical situation. Why is trust the most
   important thing in making a breakthrough with a
   client?....Maureen, stop the oral fixation for a moment
   and..join us.....Vinnie.

				VINNIE
   Um...because uh...trust is...uh...trust is life.

				SEAN
   Wow. That's very deep. Thank you, Vinnie. Next time
   get the notes from your brother. (Now, the patient is
   here to say no. If trusting won't go past this), then
   there's really no point in them being in therapy. I mean,
   hey, if they don't trust you, you know, you're never
   gunna get them to sleep with ya' and that should be the
   goal of any good therapist...nail them while they're
   vulnerable. That's my motto.....Oh, good, everyone's
   back. Welcome back everybody.

				LAMBEAU
   Hello, Sean.

				SEAN
   Hey, Gerry. Um...Ladies and Gentlemen, we're in the
   presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau.
   Fields Medal Winner for Combinatory Mathematics.

				LAMBEAU
   Hello.

				SEAN
   Anyone know what the Fields Medal is? It's a really big
   deal. It's like the Nobel Prize for math, except they only
   give it out once every four years. It's a great thing. It's
   an amazing honor. Okay, everybody, that's it for today.
   Thanks and...we'll see you Monday? We'll be talking
   about Freud, and why he did enough cocaine to kill a
   small horse.  Thank you. How are you?

				LAMBEAU
   Good to see you.

				SEAN
   Good to see you.

				LAMBEAU
   Sean

				SEAN
   Yeah.

				LAMBEAU
   I think I got something interesting for ya'.

				SEAN
   What? You hafta' have blood and urine? What's up?

Lockober Restaurant

				LAMBEAU
   Why didn't you come to the reunion?

				SEAN
   Ah...you know, I..I've been busy.

				LAMBEAU
   You were missed.

				SEAN
   Really?

				LAMBEAU
   So, how long has it been since we've seen each other?

				SEAN
   Before Nancy died.

				LAMBEAU
   Uh, yeah, I'm sorry. I was in Paris. It was that damned
   conference. I--

				SEAN
   Got your card. It was nice.

Funland Batting Cages

				BILLY
   Com'on! Submit!

				WILL
   Now that's a good take down.

				CHUCKIE
   Hey, uh..What happened? You uh..get leniency, or
   what?

				WILL
   I got uh..probation, and then, uh..counseling, two days a
   week.

				CHUCKIE
   Joke. You're a smoothie. Com'on, Morgan, just submit!

				MORGAN
   Uueeeeuuunnnh!

				WILL
   Hey, Bill, just--just get off him, we're gunna' miss the
   game.

Back At The Restaurant

				SEAN
   I've got a full schedule.

				LAMBEAU
   Sean. Sean.

				SEAN

   And I'm very busy with a full schedule.

				LAMBEAU
   This--this boy is incredible. I've never seen anything
   like him.

				SEAN
   What makes him so incredible, Gerry?

				LAMBEAU
   Ever heard of Ramanujan?

				SEAN
   Yeah, I.......no.

				LAMBEAU
   It's a man.

				SEAN
   nn.

				LAMBEAU
   Lived over a hundred years ago. he was uh..Indian.

				LAMBEAU AND SEAN
   Dots not feathers.

				SEAN
   Yeah.

				LAMBEAU
   And he lived in this tiny hut somewhere in India, but he
   had no formal education. He had no access to any
   scientific work. and um...but he came across this old
   math text. And from this simple text, he was able to
   extrapolate theories that had baffled mathematicians for
   years.

				SEAN
   Yeah...continued fractions. He uh..he wrote it with
   a..a...

				LAMBEAU
   Well he--he mailed it to Hardy at

				SEAN
   Yeah.

				LAMBEAU
   Cambridge.

				SEAN
   Yeah.

				LAMBEAU
   And Hardy immediately recognized the brilliance of his
   work.

				SEAN
   mm-hmm.

				LAMBEAU
   And brought him over to England. And then they
   worked together for years creating some of the most
   exciting math theory ever done. Now this..this
   Ramanujan, his--his genius was unparalleled, Sean. Now
   this boy is just like that.

				SEAN
   hm.

				LAMBEAU
   But he's um..he's a bit defensive.

				SEAN
   nnn.

				LAMBEAU
   n I need someone who can get through to him.

				SEAN
   Like me.

				LAMBEAU
   Yeah, like you.

				SEAN
   Why?

				LAMBEAU
   Well, because you have the same kind of background.

				SEAN
   What background?

				LAMBEAU
   Well, you're from the same neighborhood.

				SEAN
   He's from Southie?

				LAMBEAU
   Yeah.

				SEAN
   Boy genius from Southie...How many shrinks you go to
   before me?

				LAMBEAU
   Heh...Five.

				SEAN
   Lemme guess. Barry.

				LAMBEAU
   Yeah.

				SEAN
   Henry.

				LAMBEAU
   Yeah.

				SEAN
   Not Rich...

				LAMBEAU
   Sean, please...

				SEAN
   mm-hmm.

				LAMBEAU
   Just meet with him. Once a week. Please...

Sean's Office

				LAMBEAU
   It's a poker game with this kid. Don't let him know what
   you got. He's probably even read your book

				SEAN
   If he can find it. It's going to be hard for him to find.

				LAMBEAU
   Hi, Will. Com'on in here. This is Sean McGuire. Will
   Hunting.

				SEAN
   How are you?

				LAMBEAU
   Yeah, let's get started.

				WILL
   Yeah, let's do it, I'm pumped! Let's let the healing
   begin.

				SEAN
   Will you excuse us?

				LAMBEAU
   Yeah, please, Tom.

				SEAN
   You, too, Gerry.


				LAMBEAU
	Yeah, of course.

				SEAN
	 How are you? Where are you from in Southie?

				WILL
	I like what you've done with the place.

				SEAN
	Oh, thanks.

				WILL
	Do you buy all these books retail or do you send away
	for like a shrink kit that comes with all these volumes
	included?

				SEAN
	Do you like books?

				WILL
	Yeah.

				SEAN
	Did you read any of these books?

				WILL
	I dunno.

				SEAN
	How about any of these books?

				WILL
	Probably not.

				SEAN
	What about the ones on the top shelf? You read those?

				WILL
	Yeah, I read those.

				SEAN
	Good for you. What do you think about 'em?

				WILL
	Hey I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're
	your books. What don't you read them?

				SEAN
	I did. I had to.

				WILL
	That must'a taken you a long time.

				SEAN
	Yeah, it did.

				WILL
	The United States of America, A Complete History,
	Volume I. Jesus...You wanna read a real History book,
	read Howard Zinn's People of the United States, that
	book will fuckin' knock you on your ass.

				SEAN
	Better than Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent? You
	think that's a good book?

				WILL
	You fuckin' people baffle me. Spend all your money on
	these fuckin' fancy books you surround yourselves with
	'em and they're the wrong fucking books.

				SEAN
	Then what're the right fuckin' books, Will?

				WILL
	Hey, whatever blows your hair back.

				SEAN
	Yeah...I haven't got much hair left. Hey..you know
	you'd be better off shoving that cigarette up your ass,
	it'd probably be healthier for you.

				WILL
	Yeah, I know, it really gets in the way of my Yoga.

				SEAN
	You work out, huh?

				WILL
	What, you lift?

				SEAN
	Yeah.

				WILL
	You on Nautilus?

				SEAN
	No, on free weights.

				WILL
	Oh really?

				SEAN
	Yeah.

				WILL
	Free weights, huh?

				SEAN
	Yeah, big time.

				WILL
	eah.

				SEAN
	Just like that.

				WILL
	What do you bench?

				SEAN
	285. What do you bench?

				WILL
	 You paint that?

				SEAN
	Yeah. You paint?

				WILL
	uh-unh.

				SEAN
	Do you sculpt?

				WILL
	Nope.

				SEAN
	Dya' like art? Do ya' like music?

				WILL
	It's a real piece of shit.

				SEAN
	Oh..Well, tell me what you really think.

				WILL
	Uh, just the--the linear n impressionistic mix makes a
	very muddled composition. It's also a Winslow Homer
	rip-off, except you got Whitey uh..rowin the boat there.

				SEAN
	Well, it's art, Monet...wasn't very good.

				WILL
	That's not really what concerns me, though.

				SEAN
	What concerns you?

				WILL
   It's the coloring.

				SEAN
   You know what the real bitch of it is? It's paint by
   number.

				WILL
   Is it color by number? Because the colors are fascinating
   to me.

				SEAN
   Are they really? What about that?

				WILL
   I think you're about one step away from cuttin' your
   fuckin' ear off.

				SEAN
   Really?

				WILL
   Oh yeah..

				SEAN
   Think I should move to the south of France n change my
   name to Vincent.

				WILL
   You ever heard the saying "any port in a storm?"

				SEAN
   Yeah.

				WILL
   Yeah, maybe that means you.

				SEAN
   In what way?

				WILL
   ell, maybe you're in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin'
   storm.

				SEAN
   eah, maybe.

				WILL
   The sky's fallin' on your head, the waves are crashin'
   over your little boat, the oars are about to snap. You
   just piss in your pants, you're cryin' for the harbors,
   and maybe you do what you gotta do to get out. Yeah,
   maybe you became a psychologist.

				SEAN
   Bingo. That's it. Lemme do my job now, we still have a
   minute. Com'on.

				WILL
   Maybe you married the wrong woman.

				SEAN
   Maybe you should watch your mouth. Watch it right
   there, chief, all right?                         WILL
   Ah...Well, that's it, isn't it? You married the wrong
   woman. What happened? What, d'she leave you? Was
   she, you know, banging some other guy?

				SEAN
   If you ever disrespect my wife again, I will end you, I
   will fuckin' end you. Got that, chief?

				WILL
   Time's up.

				SEAN
   Yeah. In The Hallway

				WILL
   At ease, gentlemen.

Sean's Office

				LAMBEAU
   You okay?. . . . I--I'll understand if you don't wanna
   meet with him again.

				SEAN
   Thursday, four o'clock. Make sure the kid's here.

				LAMBEAU
   Yeah....Thanks.....

Toy Shop

				TOY STORE CASHIER
   Well, you look lovely in those glasses.

				SKYLAR
   Thank you very much.

				TOY STORE CASHIER
   Just beautiful.

				SKYLAR
   Yes. I always wanted a..blue eye-shadow.

				TOY STORE CASHIER
   Wonderful.

				SKYLAR
   Growing up in England, you know, I went to a very
   nice school. You know, it was kind of progressive,
   organic, do-it-yourself, private school. Then Harvard.
   And then med-school. You know, if you think about it,
   at the end, my brain's going to be worth two hundred
   and fifty thousand dollars...That sounded horrible,
   didn't it?.....Bring me another maitai!

				WILL
   No, that's cool, I mean, I bet your parents were happy
   to pay.

				SKYLAR
   No one else had to pay. I inherited the money.

				WILL
   Wow..well is uh...is Harvard gettin' all that money?

				SKYLAR
   No, Stanford. I'm going there in June when I graduate.

				WILL
   Oh, all right, so you just wanted to--to use this sailor
   and then uh..run away, huh?

				SKYLAR
   Well, I was gunna, you know, experiment on you for
   anatomy class first. Obviously.

				WILL
   In that case, that's fine. Hey, you wanna see my magic
   trick, Skylar?

				SKYLAR
   Of course.

				WILL
   All right. All right...This one's for you, Rudolph.

				SKYLAR
   Wait, wait, you need my wand.

				WILL
   All right, gimme a hit. Thank you. All right. I'll make
   all these caramels disappear. Y'ready? One. Two.
   Three.

				SKYLAR
   hhhhhhhaaaaaaw...

				WILL
   They're all gone. Yeah...It works better when I have my
   rabbit.

At a Cafe in Harvard Square

				WILL
	Well, I don't really date, you know, that much.

				SKYLAR
   How very unfortunate. I think for me. You know what I
   mean. I know you've been thinking about this.
   (reference to Annie Hall, 1977)

				WILL
   Oh-ho, no I haven't.

				SKYLAR
   Yes you have.

				WILL
   Oh, no, I really haven't.

				SKYLAR
   Yes you have! You were hoping to get a goodnight
   kiss.

				WILL
   Well, you know, I'll tell you, I was hopin' to get a
   goodnight laid....But I'll settle for like, a kiss, you
   know.

				SKYLAR
   How very noble of you.

				WILL
   Thank you. No, I was--I was hopin' for a kiss.

				SKYLAR
   Well, why don't we just get it over with now?

				WILL
   Right now?

				SKYLAR
   Yup. Com'on..=-*..I think I got some of your pickle.
   Sean's Office

				WILL
   You again, huh?

				SEAN
   Come with me.

Swan Pond in Boston Common

				WILL
   So what's this? A Taster's Choice moment between
   guys? This is really nice. You got a thing for swans? Is
   this like a fetish? It's something, like, maybe we need
   to devote some time to?

				SEAN
	I thought about what you said to me the other day,
   about my painting.

				WILL
   eah?

				SEAN
   Stayed up half the night thinking about it. Something
   occurred to me, I fell into a deep peaceful sleep, and I
   haven't thought about you since. You know what
   occurred to me?

				WILL
   No.

				SEAN
   You're just a kid. You don't have the faintest idea what
   you're talking about.

				WILL
   Why thank you.

				SEAN
   It's all right. You've never been out of Boston.

				WILL
   Nope.

				SEAN
	So, if I asked you about art, you'd probably give
   me the skinny on every art book ever written.
   Michelangelo. You know a lot about him. Life's work,
   political aspirations, him and the pope, sexual
   orientation, the whole works, right? But I bet you
   can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.
   You've never actually stood there and looked up at that
   beautiful ceiling. Seen that....If I ask you about
   women, you'd probably give me a syllabus of your
   personal favorites. You may have even been laid a few
   times. But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake
   up next to a woman and feel truly happy. You're a
   tough kid. I ask you about war, you'd probably
   uh...throw Shakespeare at me, right? "Once more into
   the breach, dear friends." But you've never been near
   one. You've never held your best friend's head in your
   lap, and watched him gasp his last breath looking to
   you for help. I ask you about love, y'probably quote
   me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and
   been totally vulnerable...known someone that could
   level you with her eyes. Feeling like God put an angel
   on Earth just for you..who could rescue you from the
   depths of Hell. And you wouldn't know what it's like
   to be her angel, n to have that love for her be there
   forever. Through anything. Through cancer. And you
   wouldn't know about sleepin' sittin' up in a hospital
   room for two months, holding her hand because the
   doctors could see in your eyes that the terms visiting
   hours don't apply to you. You don't know about real
   loss, because that only occurs when you love
   something more than you love yourself. I doubt you've
   ever dared to love anybody that much. I look at you: I
   don't see an intelligent, confident man. I see a cocky,
   scared shitless kid. But you're a genius, Will. No one
   denies that. no one could possibly understand the
   depths of you. But you presume to know everything
   about me because you saw a painting of mine and
   ripped my fuckin' life apart. You're an orphan, right?
   Do you think I'd know the first thing about how hard
   your life has been, how you feel, who you are because
   I read Oliver Twist? Does that encapsulate you?
   Personally, I don't give a shit about that, because you
   know what? I can't learn anything from you I can't
   read in some fuckin' book. Unless you wanna talk
   about you, who you are. And I'm fascinated. I'm in.
   But you don't wanna do that, do you, sport? You're
   terrified of what you might say.  Your move,
   chief. At a Phone Booth out in the Rain and Skylar's Room

				SKYLAR
   Hello. Hello? Hello...Professor Valenti, are you calling
   me again? Freak.

In Car

				WILL
   Ugh, it's pouring.

				CHUCKIE
   Who'd you call?

				WILL
   No one. I forgot the number.

				MORGAN
   You're fucking retarded. You went all the way out
   there in the rain and you didn't bring the number?

				WILL
	No, it was your mother's 900 number, I just ran
   outta' quarters.

				MORGAN
   Why don't we get off of mothers I just got off of
   yours.                         BILLY
   That's pretty funny, Morgan.
		 (throwing beer can at Morgan's head)
   Here's your fuckin' nickle bitch.

				MORGAN
   Keep antagonizing me, watch what happens!

				BILLY
   All right, then, Morgan.

				MORGAN
   Watch what happens.

				BILLY
   All right then, Morgan.

				MORGAN
   Watch what happens...keep fucking with me.

Sean's Office

				SEAN
   No smoking.

Later
				LAMBEAU
   What do you mean you didn't talk? You were in there
   for an hour.

				SEAN
   He just sat there counting the seconds until the session
   was over. Pretty impressive, actually.

				LAMBEAU
   Why would he do that?

				SEAN
   t'Prove to me he doesn't have to talk to me if he
   doesn't want to.

				LAMBEAU
	What is this, some kind of staring contest between
   two kids from the old neighborhood?

				SEAN
   Yeah, it is. And I can't talk first. Lambeau's Office

				LAMBEAU
   We know your theory, Alexander, but the boy's found
   a simple geometrical picture.

				MIT PROFESSOR
   A tree structure won't work.

				LAMBEAU
   Look, now, he's joining the two vertices.

				MIT PROFESSOR
   But I can do the sum.

				LAMBEAU
   Well, it's how you group the terms, Alexander.

				MIT PROFESSOR
   But, Gerry, if we do the whole thing this way then--

				WILL
   Hey, look, look. I wrote it down. It's--it's simpler this
   way.

				TOM
   Sometimes people get lucky. You're a brilliant man.

Sean's Office

				WILL
You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sitting
   there and uh...the captain gets on, he does his whole,
   you know, we'll be cruisin' at 35,000 feet. But then he
   puts the mic down n forgets to turn it off.

				SEAN
   mm-hmm.

				WILL
   And so he turns to the co-pilot n he's like, "you know,
   all I could use right now is a fuckin' blow job and a cup
   of coffee." So the stewardess fuckin' goes bombin' up
   from the back of the plane to tell him that the
   microphone's still on. N this guy in the back of the plane
   is like, "Hey, hon, don't forget the coffee!"                         SEAN
   You ever been on a plane?

				WILL
   No, but it's a fuckin' joke. It works better if I tell it in
   the first person.

				SEAN
   Yeah, it does.

				WILL
   I have been laid, you know.

				SEAN
   Really? Good for you.

				WILL
   Big time.

				SEAN
   Big time, huh?

				WILL
	I went on a date last week.

				SEAN
   How'd it go?

				WILL
   It was good.

				SEAN
   Goin' out again?

				WILL
   I dunno.

				SEAN
   Why not?

				WILL
   Haven't called her.

				SEAN
   Christ, you're an amateur.

				WILL
   I know what I'm doin'.

				SEAN
   Yeah.

				WILL
	Yeah. Don't worry about me, I know what I'm doin'.
   Yeah, but this girl is like, you know, beautiful. She's
   smart. She's funny. She's different from most of the
   girls I've been with.

				SEAN
   So, call her up, Romeo.

				WILL
   Why? So I can realize she's not that smart, that she's
   fuckin' boring? Y'know--I mean...this girl is like
   fuckin' perfect right now, I don't wanna r--ruin that.

				SEAN
   Maybe you're perfect right now. Maybe you don't
   wanna ruin that. I think that's a super philosophy, Will,
   that way you can go through your entire life without
   ever having to really know anybody....My wife used to
   fart when she was nervous. She had all sorts of
   wonderful idiosyncrasies. You know what? She used to
   fart in her sleep. Sorry I shared that with you. One
   night it was so loud it woke the dog up. She woke up
   and gone like "oh was that you?" 'd say yeah...I didn't
   have the heart to tell her...Oh God...

				WILL
   She woke herself up?

				SEAN
   Ye e e e sss.... Oh Christ....aahhh, but, Will, she's been
   dead two years and that's the shit I remember.
   Wonderful stuff, you know, little things like that. Ah,
   but, those are the things I miss the most. The little
   idiosyncrasies that only I knew about. That's what made
   her my wife. Oh and she had the goods on me, too, she
   knew all my little peccadillos.  People call these things
   imperfections, but they're not, aw that's the good stuff.            And then we get to choose who we let in to our weird
   little worlds.  You're not perfect, sport. And let me
   save you the suspense. This girl you met, she isn't
   perfect either. But the question is: whether or not you're
   perfect for each other.  That's the whole deal. That's
   what intimacy is all about. Now you can know
   everything in the world, sport, but the only way you're
   findin' out that one is by givin' it a shot. You certainly
   won't learn from an old fucker like me.  Even if I did
   know, I wouldn't tell a piss ant like you.                         WILL
   Why not? You told me every other fuckin' thing. Jesus
   Christ. Fuckin' talk more than any shrink I ever seen in
   my life.

				SEAN
   I teach this shit, I didn't say I know how to do it.

				WILL
   Yeah.......You ever think about gettin' remarried?

				SEAN
   My wife's dead.

				WILL
   Hence the word: remarried.

				SEAN
   She's dead.

				WILL
   Yeah..  Well, I think that's a super philosophy, Sean. I
   mean that way you could actually go through the rest of
   your life without ever really knowing anybody.
				SEAN
   Time's up. Outside Harvard Dorms

				WILL
   Hold the door.

				HARVARD STUDENT
   Okay.

				WILL
   Thank you.

Skylar's Room

				SKYLAR
   Hello.

				WILL
   Hey.

				SKYLAR
   Where've you been?

				WILL
   I'm sorry, I've been like..I've been really busy and..but

	just, can't right now. I've got to assign the proton
	spectrum for ibogamine. Although it sounds really
	really interesting it's actually fantastically boring.

				SKYLAR
	Ohhhh, I hope it was the one with the open toed sandals
	and the really bad breath.

				WILL
	Com'on let's go have some fun.

				SKYLAR
	No. I--I've got to learn this.

				WILL
	Well, you're not going into surgery tomorrow, are ya'?

				SKYLAR
	No.

				WILL
	Let's go. Wonderland Dog Track

				SKYLAR
	Oh my God my dog is winning! Go Misty! Go on run!
	Look at that. Com'on. Look there it goes. Misty run.
	Run!

				WILL
	You won.

				SKYLAR
	I totally won!...So, did you grow up around here, then?

				WILL
	Not far. South Boston.

				SKYLAR
	I'm still glowing from my win.

				WILL
	Yeah, I know. I mean look at you, you're just so happy.

				SKYLAR
	And what was that like then?

				WILL
	It was, you know, normal, I guess. Nothin' special.

				SKYLAR
	Do you got lots of brothers and sisters?

				WILL
	Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?

				SKYLAR
	That's what I said.

				WILL
	Well, I'm Irish Catholic. What do you think?

				SKYLAR
	Oh...That's right. But how many?

				WILL
	Aw, you wouldn't believe me if I told you.

				SKYLAR
	Why? Go on. What? Five? Seven? Eight? How many?

				WILL
	 I have twelve big brothers.

				SKYLAR
	You do not.

				WILL
	No, I swear to God. I swear to God. I'm lucky 13 right
	here.

				SKYLAR
	Do you know all their names?

				WILL
	Do I--? Yeah they're my brothers.

				SKYLAR
	What're they called?

				WILL
	Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy,
	Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.

				SKYLAR
	Say it again.

				WILL
	Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy,
	Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.

				SKYLAR
	And Willy.

				WILL
	Willy?

				SKYLAR
   Yeah.

				WILL
   Will.                         SKYLAR
   Wow. Do you still see all of them?

				WILL
   Yeah. Well, they all live in Southie I--I'm livin' with
   three of them right now.

				SKYLAR
   Oh yeah?

				WILL
   Yeah.

				SKYLAR
   'ell, I'd like to meet them.

				WILL
   Yeah, we'll do that.

Sean's Office

				WILL
   Oh, you know, I read your book last night.

				SEAN
   Oh, so you're the one.

				WILL
   Do you still uh...do you still counsel veterans?

				SEAN
   No..I don't.

				WILL
   Why not?

				SEAN
   Well, I gave it up when my wife got sick.

				WILL
   You ever wonder what your life would be like if you
   uh..if you never met your wife?

				SEAN
   What? Wonder if I'd be better off without her?

				WILL
   no,no,no, I'm not saying, like, better off.

				SEAN
   No.

				WILL
   I didn't mean it like that.

				SEAN
   It's all right. It's an important question.  Cus' you'll
   have bad times, but that'll always wake you up to the
   good stuff you weren't paying attention to.                         WILL
   And you don't regret meetin' your wife?

				SEAN
   Why? Because of the pain I feel now? Well, I got
   regrets, Will, but I don't regret a single day I spent with
   her.

				WILL
	So, when did you know, like, that she was the one
   for you?

				SEAN
   October 21st, 1975.

				WILL
   Jesus Christ. You know the fuckin' date?

				SEAN
   Oh yeah. Cus' it was game six of the World Series.
   Biggest game in Red Sox history.

				WILL
   Yeah, sure.

				SEAN
   My friends and I had, you know, slept out on the
   sidewalk all night to get tickets.

				WILL
   You got tickets?

				SEAN
   Yep. Day of the game. I was sittin' in a bar, waitin' for
   the game to start, and in walks this girl. Oh it was an
   amazing game, though. You know, bottom of the 8th
   Carbo ties it up at a 6-6. It went to 12. Bottom of the
   12th, in stepped Carlton Fisk. Old Pudge. Steps up to the
   plate, you know, and he's got that weird stance.

				WILL
   Yeah, yeah.

				SEAN
   And BAM! He clocks it. High fly ball down the left field
   line! Thirty-five thousand people, on their feet, yellin'
   at the ball, but that's not because of Fisk. He's wavin' at
   the ball like a madman.

				WILL
   Yeah, I've seen...

				SEAN
   He's going, "Get over! Get over! Get OVER!" And then
   it HITS the foul pole. OH, he goes apeshit, and 35,000
   fans, you know, they charge the field, you know?                         WILL
   Yeah, and he's fuckin' bowlin' police out of the way!

				SEAN
   Goin' "God! Get out of the way! Get 'em away!"
   Banging people..

				WILL
   I can't fuckin' believe you had tickets to that fuckin'
   game!

				SEAN
   Yeah!

				WILL
	Did you rush the field?

				SEAN
   No..I didn't rush the fuckin' field, I wasn't there.

				WILL
   What?

				SEAN
   No..I was in a bar havin' a drink with my future wife.                         WILL
   You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun?

				SEAN
   Oh yeah.

				WILL
   To have a fuckin' drink with some lady you never met?

				SEAN
   Yeah, but you shoulda' seen her. She was a stunner.

				WILL
   I don't care if fuckin'--

				SEAN
   Oh no, no, she lit up the room.

				WILL
   I don't care if Helen of Troy walks in the room, that's
   game six!

				SEAN
   Oh, Helen of Troy..

				WILL
	Oh my God, and who are these fuckin' friends of
   yours they let you get away with that?

				SEAN
   Oh...They had to.

				WILL
   W-w-w-what'd you say to them?

				SEAN
   I just slid my ticket across the table and I said, "Sorry
   guys, I gotta' see about a girl."

				WILL
   I gotta' go see about a girl?

				SEAN
   Yeah.

				WILL
   That's what you said? And they let you get away with
   that?

				SEAN

   Oh yeah. They saw in my eyes that I meant it.

				WILL
   You're kiddin' me.

				SEAN
   No, I'm not kiddin' you, Will. That's why I'm not
   talkin' right now about some girl I saw at a bar twenty
   years ago and how I always regretted not going over
   and talking to her.  I don't regret the 18 years I was
   married to Nancy. I don't regret the six years I had to
   give up counseling when she got sick. And I don't regret
   the last years when she got really sick. And I sure as hell
   don't regret missin' the damn game. That's regret.

				WILL
   Wow... Woulda' been nice to catch that game, though.

				SEAN
   I didn't know Pudge was gunna hit a homer.

Skylar's Room

				SKYLAR
   You know, I'm very very useful on the court. I'm
   extremely tall.

				WILL
   You're not that tall.

				SKYLAR
   I dunk....Will I ever play in the NBA?....It is decidedly
   so. hm. Why do we always stay here?

				WILL
   Cus' it's nicer than my place.

				SKYLAR
   Yes, but I've never seen your place.

				WILL
   I know.

				SKYLAR
   When am I going to meet your friends, and your
   brothers?

				WILL
   Oh...well, they don't really come down here that much.

				SKYLAR
   Well, I think I can make it to South Boston.

				WILL
   It's kind of a hike.

				SKYLAR
   Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way
   around?

				WILL
   All right, we'll go.

				SKYLAR
   When?

				WILL
   I dunno..We'll go sometime next week.

				SKYLAR
	What if I said I would not sleep with you again until
   you let me meet your friends?

				WILL
   I'd say it's like 4:30 in the morning, they're probably
   up.

				SKYLAR
   Oh my god. Men are shameless. If you're not thinking
   with your wiener, then you're acting directly on its
   behalf.

				WILL
   You bet. And on behalf of my wiener, can I get like an
   advanced payment?                         SKYLAR
   Well, let's ask....Outlook does not look good.

				CHUCKIE
		 (over the telephone)
   What?

				WILL
   Fuck tha--Hey, Chuck, no, nothing. Go back to sleep.
   Outlook does not--that's the same thing that told you you
   was gunna play in the NBA.

				SKYLAR
   Well, exactly, so look out. You'd better start buying
   some season tickets. I--I plan to..I'm tall. I like wearing
   shorts. Hook hook! Dunk dunk!

				WILL
   You're not that tall.

				SKYLAR
   Yes I am. Maybe I'm all about three points.

				WILL
   I'm all about homeruns.

				SKYLAR
   Stop mixing your sporting...

L Street Bar and Grille

				CHUCKIE
   The leprechaun's uh..got his dick in the monkey's ass
   and the monkey comes running in going, "I don't..."

				MORGAN
   Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when
   we're fuckin' all bombed and drinking.

				WILL
   Hey no, Morgan, it's a real rarity we'd be all drinkin'.

				CHUCKIE
   You know, my uncle Marty drinks. Yeah. Been goin' on a
   bender (?) for six, eight months.

				BILLY
   Yeah.

				CHUCKIE
   I ever tell you what happened to him when he was
   driving up there and he got pulled over? I told you
   guys, right?

				WILL
   Uncle Marty. yeah.

				MORGAN
   You did tell us.

				CHUCKIE
   Well, let me tell you--well, let me tell you what
   happened to my Uncle Marty because good reason you
   oughtta' know this.

				MORGAN
   He's always tellin' stories over here. Every time we
   come here he's got another story. But we all heard this
   one. Go ahead. Just say it anyway, go ahead.

				CHUCKIE
   I will go ahead. Thanks a lot. I guess I have the floor,
   now. Um...yeah, my uncle Marty's drivin' home, right?
   Bombed out of his tree, right. Just hammered out of his
   gourd. Just cracked. And this state trooper, uh..sees
   him, pulls him over. So, my uncle's fucked, basically.
   Got him out of the car, try to make him walk the line.
   He gets out of the car and, you know, pukes on the guy.
   Statie's pretty sure he's over the legal limit. So, he's
   about to throw the cuffs on him and put him in jail. And
   all of a sudden fifty yards down the road, there's this
   huge fuckin' boom, right. So, Statie gets real spooked,
   and he turns around...

				MORGAN
   Gunshot?

				CHUCKIE
   No, some, some...You've heard this story before...Some
   other guy's car had hit a tree. Okay, there was an
   accident. Anyway.

				MORGAN
   How can he hear the other--

				CHUCKIE
   Shut the fuck up! Shut up. Okay. Shut up.

				BILLY
   You're driving me nuts, Morgan. He told you this story
   once before, Morgan.

				CHUCKIE
   So, he tells my uncle, "Stay here. Don't move." So the
   Statie goes running down the..road to deal with the
   other accident. After a few minutes of--of just lying in
   his own piss and vomit, my uncle starts wonderin' what
   he's doing there. Gets up. Gets in his car. And just
   drives home. Well, the next morning, my uncle's just
   passed out, and hears this knocking at the door. So he
   goes downstairs, fuckin' pulls the door open. "What!"
   It's the state trooper that pulled him over. Statie's like,
   "What the fuck do you mean, 'What?' You know what. I
   pulled you over last night is what, and you fuckin' took
   off." He's like "Bitch, I never seen you before in my
   life. I've been home all night with my kids. I don't know
   who the fuck you are." He's like, "You know who I am.
   Lemme get in your garage." And my uncle's like
   "What?" He's like, "you heard me, lemme get in your
   garage." He's like, "All right, fine." Takes him out to
   the garage and opens the door, and there's...the Statie's
   police cruiser, is in my uncle's garage. He was so
   fuckin' hammered he drove the wrong car home. And
   the best part about it is, the fuckin' state trooper had
   been so embarrassed, he didn't do anything. Cus' he'd
   been drivin' around all night in my uncle's Chevelle
   lookin' for the house.

				MORGAN
   All right, Chuck. What the fuck is the point to your
   story?


				CHUCKIE
   Well, he got away. That's the point.

				MORGAN
   Well, question. Are you--are you--?

				BILLY
   Com'on, stop it.

				MORGAN
   I'm trying to clarify something probably you're too
   embarrassed to ask cus' you know it doesn't make any
   sense.

				BILLY
   It does make sense if you listen to the story and quit
   asking questions.

				SKYLAR
	Well, let's see if you can get this one. I've got a little
   story for you. All right. There's an old couple in bed.
   Mary and Paddy. And they wake up on the morning
   their..fiftieth anniversary. And Mary looks over and
   gazes adoringly at Paddy, she's like, "Aw, Jesus, Paddy.
   You're such a good lookin' feller. I love you. I want to
   give you a little present. Anything your little heart
   desires, I'm going to give it to ya'. What would you
   like?" And Paddy's like, "Aw, gee, Mary, that's a very
   sweet offer. Now, in fifty years, there's one thing that's
   been missing. And uh...I would like you to give me a
   blow job. I would like that." And Mary's like, "All
   right." She takes her teeth out, puts them in the glass,
   and she gives him a blow job. And afterwards, Paddy's
   like, "Ah, geez, now THAT's what I've been missin'.
   That was the most beautiful, Earth-shatterin' thing ever.
   Beautiful Mary, I love ya'! Is there anything that I can
   do for you?" And Mary looks up at him and she goes,
   "Give us a kiss!"

				CHUCKIE
   Oh my god!

				BILLY
   That's filthy.

				MORGAN
   It's not that filthy. I've heard filthier. Outside

				BILLY
   See you guys, Sunday

				CHUCKIE
   All right, take it easy, Bill. So, Skylar, thanks for
   coming by. You changed my opinion of Harvard people.

				SKYLAR
   Oh, well you don't wanna rush to judgement on that one
   cus', you know, they're not all like me.

				CHUCKIE
   Well, I'm sure. It was nice to meet you.

				WILL
   Take it easy.

				CHUCKIE
   Oh, all right.

				WILL
   Slowly back away.

				CHUCKIE
   Brother!

				WILL
   I dunno what you're doing. You're giving us a ride.

				CHUCKIE
   What the fuck do I look like to you?

				MORGAN
   Com'on, Chuck!

				CHUCKIE
   Cus' you're walkin' bitch! Will's takin' the car!

				WILL
   All right. Thanks, Chuck. I appreciate it.

				CHUCKIE
   Well, don't be getting all serious about it. You're
   dropping me off first.

				WILL
   It's really out of the way.

				CHUCKIE
   Oh..Okay...Just cus' you don't hafta' sleep in your one
   room palace tonight don't start thinkin' you're bad.

				SKYLAR
   Hey, wait a minute, you said we were going to see your
   place.

				WILL
   No, not tonight.

				CHUCKIE
   Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night, hon. He knows
   once you see that little shithole he's getting dropped like
   a bad habit.

				SKYLAR
   But I want to meet your brothers.

				WILL
   No, we're going to do that another time.

				SKYLAR
   All right.

				WILL
   Get them keys?

Timmy's Tap

				SEAN
   The stewardess hears this and goes hauling ass down the
   aisle. And I yell, "Don't forget the coffee!"

				GUY AT THE BAR
   Bullshit. You didn't say that.

				TIMMY
   For Christ's sake, Marty, it's a joke.

				SEAN
   Yeah, I know someone it actually happened to, Marty.

				TIMMY
   A joke.

				SEAN
   Gerry. Hi. Trouble finding the place?

				LAMBEAU
   No. I took a cab.

				SEAN
   Timmy, this is Gerry. We went to college together.

				TIMMY
   How're you doin'? Nice to meet you.

				LAMBEAU
   Nice to meet you.

				SEAN
   Can I get you a beer?

				LAMBEAU
   Um..No, just a perrier.

				SEAN
   That's French for Club Soda.

				TIMMY
   Oh. Club soda, yeah.

				SEAN
   Yeah.

				TIMMY
   Yeah.

				SEAN
   Couple a sandwiches, too.


				TIMMY
   Sure.

				SEAN
   Put it on my tab.

				TIMMY
   You ever plan on paying your tab?

				SEAN
   Yeah, chief. Got the winning lottery ticket right here.

				TIMMY
   What's the jackpot?

				SEAN
   Twelve million.

				TIMMY
   I don't think that'll cover it.

				SEAN
   Yeah, but it'll cover your sex change
   operation..........Nuts?

				LAMBEAU
   No, thank you.

				SEAN
   So, you wanted to talk about Will.

				LAMBEAU
   Well, it seems to be going well.

				SEAN
   I think so.

				LAMBEAU
   Have you talked to him at all about his future?

				SEAN
   No..we haven't gotten into that yet. We're still banging
   away at the past.

				LAMBEAU
   Well, maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off
   the hook with job offers.

				SEAN
   What kind?

				LAMBEAU
   Well, cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind
   of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.

				SEAN
   That's...that's great that there are offers, but I--I don't
   really think he's ready for that.

				LAMBEAU
   I'm not sure you understand, Sean.

				SEAN
   Well, what don't I understand?

				TIMMY
   Here you go guys.

				SEAN
   Thanks, Tim.

				LAMBEAU
   Yeah, thank you.

				TIMMY
   So, you don't get sticky fingers.

				LAMBEAU
   Tim, can you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.

				TIMMY
   Uh-oh.

				LAMBEAU
   You ever heard of Jonas Salk?

				TIMMY
   Sure. Cured polio.

				LAMBEAU
   And you've heard of Albert Einstein?

				TIMMY
   hmph. . Hey..

				LAMBEAU
   How about, Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?

				TIMMY
   No.

				LAMBEAU
   Thank you, Tim.

				TIMMY
   So, who won the bet?

				LAMBEAU
   I did...This isn't about me Sean. I'm...I'm nothing
   compared to this young man.

				TIMMY
		 (to the man at the bar)
   You ever hear of Gerald Lambeau?

				LAMBEAU
   In 1905 there were hundreds of professors renowned
   for their study of the universe, but it was a..it was a 26
   year old Swiss patent clerk, doing physics in his spare
   time who changed the world. Can you imagine if
   Einstein would have given that up just to get drunk with
   his buddies and bombed (?) every night. We all would
   have lost something. Tim would never have heard of
   him.                        SEAN
   Pretty dramatic, Gerry.

				LAMBEAU
   No it isn't, Sean. This boy has that gift. He just hasn't
   got the direction, but..we can give that to him.

				SEAN
   Hey, Gerry. In the 1960's there was a young man
   graduated from the University of Michigan. Did some
   brilliant work in mathematics. Specifically bounded
   harmonic functions. Then he went on to Berkeley, was
   assistant professor, showed amazing potential, then he
   moved to Montana and he blew the competition away.

				LAMBEAU
   Yeah, so who was he?

				SEAN
   Ted Kaczynski.

				LAMBEAU
   Never heard of him.

				SEAN
   Hey, Timmy!

				TIMMY
   Yo!

				SEAN
   Who's Ted Kaczynski?

				TIMMY
   Unabomber.                        LAMBEAU
   That's exactly what I'm talking about. We gotta' give
   this kid direction. He can contribute to the world
   and..and we can help him do that.

				SEAN
   Direction's one thing. Manipulation's another. All right?

				LAMBEAU
   Sean!

				SEAN
   We hafta' let him find his own--

				LAMBEAU
   Sean! I'm not sitting at home every night twisting my
   mustache and hatching a..hatching a plan to ruin this
   boy's life. I was doing advanced mathematics when I
   was..when I was 18, and it still took me over 20 years to
   do something worthy of a Fields medal.

				SEAN
   Well, maybe he doesn't want what you want. There's
   more to life than a fuckin' Fields medal.

				LAMBEAU
   This is too important, Sean. And it's above personal
   rivalry.

				SEAN
   Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Gerry. Let's talk about the
   boy. Why don't we give him time to figure out what he
   wants?

				LAMBEAU
   That's a wonderful theory, Sean, it worked wonders for
   you, didn't it?

				SEAN
   Yeah, it did, you arrogant fuckin' prick!

				LAMBEAU
   'ell, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I came here today. I came
   here out of courtesy. I--I wanted to keep you in the
   loop.

				SEAN
   Yeah, well, nice to be in the loop.

				LAMBEAU
   The boy's in a meeting right now I set up for him..over
   at McNeil.

Interview at McNeil

				EXECUTIVE #1
   Well, Will, uh, I'm not exactly sure what you mean,
   uh...We've already offered you a position.

				CHUCKIE
   Nobody in this town works without a retainer, guys.
   You think you can find somebody who does, let me tell
   you you have my blessing. But I think we all know that
   person's not going to represent you as well as I can.

				EXECUTIVE #2
   Will, our offer is 84,000 dollars a year plus benefits.

				CHUCKIE
   Reeeeetaaaaaineeeer! Retainer.

				EXECUTIVE #2
   You want us to give you cash right now?

				CHUCKIE
   Oh, ho, ho..oh ee ee now I didn't say that. Allegedly,
   your situation, for you would be concurrently improved
   if I had 200 dollars in my back pocket right now.

				EXECUTIVE #1
   hmm...Well, I don't think I--I can uh...uh..Larry?

				EXECUTIVE #2
   I've got uh..73 dollars.

				EXECUTIVE #1
   Will you uh...Take a check?

				CHUCKIE
   Let me tell you something: you're suspect. Yeah you. I
   don't know what your reputation is, in this town, but
   after the shit you tried to pull today, you can bet I'll be
   lookin' into you. Now, the business we have here to
   fore, you can speak with my aforementioned attorney.
   Good day gentlemen, and until that day comes, keep
   your ear to the grindstone.Outdoor Cafe

				WILL
   How's it goin'?

				SKYLAR
   Fine.

				WILL
   Yeah? Good. You want some help?

				SKYLAR
   No.

				WILL
   Come on, give me one little peek and we'll go to the
   batting cages.

				SKYLAR
   Noooooooooooooo. It is actually important that I learn
   this. It's really important.

				WILL
   All right.

				SKYLAR
   To me. Okay?

				WILL
   All right. Hell, why don't we just hang out here all day?

				SKYLAR
   Yes, why don't we? All right, Mr. nosy Parker, seeing
   as your intent on breaking my balls. Lemme ask you a
   question.

				WILL
   All right.

				SKYLAR
   Do you have a photographic memory?

				WILL
   I dunno. I just kind'a remember, you know, I mean how
   do you remember your phone number? You know, you
   just do.

				SKYLAR
   Well, have you studied organic chemistry?

				WILL
   A little bit.

				SKYLAR
   Oh, just for fun.

				WILL
   Yeah, for kicks.

				SKYLAR
   Yeah, it's SO much fun studying organic chemistry. Are
   you mad? Have you completely lost your mind? Nobody
   studies it for fun. It's not a ne--necessity, especially for
   someone like you.

				WILL
   Someone like me?

				SKYLAR
   Yeah. Someone who divides their time for the evening
   between batting cages and bars. I would hardly say it
   was a necessity. You know there are very smart people
   here at Harvard, and even they have to study because
   this is really hard. And yet, you do it so easily I don't
   understand, I-I-I don't understand how your mind
   works.

				WILL
   Do you play the piano?

				SKYLAR
   I wanna talk about this.

				WILL
   No, I'm tryin' to explain it to you. Do you play the
   piano?

				SKYLAR
   Yeah, a bit.

				WILL
   All right so when you--when you look at a piano you see
   Mozart.

				SKYLAR
   I see Chopsticks.

				WILL
   All right, well, Beethoven, okay, he looked at a piano
   and it just made sense to him. He could just play.

				SKYLAR
   So, what're you saying? You play the piano?

				WILL
   No. Not a lick. I mean, I look at a piano, I see a bunch'a
   keys, three pedals, and a box of wood. but Beethoven,
   Mozart, they saw it, they could just play. I couldn't paint
   you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of
   Fenway, and I can't play the piano.

				SKYLAR
   But you can do my O Chem paper in under an hour.

				WILL
   Right. Well, I mean, when it came to stuff like that, I
   could always just play. That's the best I can explain it.

				SKYLAR
   Come here. I hafta' say something.

				WILL
   Huh?

				SKYLAR
   I have to tell you something.

				WILL
   Oh.

				SKYLAR
   Well....=-* It's not fair.

				WILL
   What's not fair? What?

				SKYLAR
   I've been here for four years, and I've only just found
   you.

				WILL
   Well, you found me.Skylar's Room

				SKYLAR
   You awake?

				WILL
   No.

				SKYLAR
   Yes you are. Will, come to California with me.

				WILL
   What?

				SKYLAR
   I want you to come to California with me.

				WILL
   Are you sure about that?

				SKYLAR
   Oh yeah.

				WILL
   Yeah, but how do you know?

				SKYLAR
   I dunno. I just know.

				WILL
   Yeah, but h--how do you know?

				SKYLAR
   I know because I feel it.

				WILL
   Because that's a really serious thing to say.

				SKYLAR
   But, I know.

				WILL
   You could be in California next week and, you know,
   you might find out something about me you don't like
   and, you know, maybe you'll wish you hadn't said that
   and then, you know, it's such a serious thing that you
   can't take it back and now I'm stuck in California with
   someone who doesn't really want to be with me who just
   wishes they had a takeback.

				SKYLAR
   A what? What's a takeback? I don't want a takeback. I
   just want you to come to California with me.

				WILL
   Well, I can't go to California with you.

				SKYLAR
   Why not?

				WILL
   Well, one, because I--I got a job here, and two, because
   I live here.

				SKYLAR
   Look, um..If you don't love me, you should tell me
   because it's such a--

				WILL
   I'm not saying I don't love you.                        SKYLAR
   Then why? Why won't you come? What are you so
   scared of?

				WILL
   What am I so scared of?

				SKYLAR
   Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in this safe
   little world where no one challenges you and you're
   scared shitless to do anything else but defend yourself
   because that would mean you'd hafta' change.

				WILL
   Oh no. Don't, don't, don't tell me about my world.
   Don't tell me about my world! I mean you just wanna
   have you fling with like the guy from the other side of
   town. Then you're going to go off to Stanford, you're
   going to marry some rich prick who your parents will
   approve of and just sit around with the other trust fund
   babies and talk about how you went slumming too, once.

				SKYLAR
   Why are you saying this? What is your obsession with
   this money? My father died when I was 13 and I
   inherited this money. Nearly every day I wake up, and I
   wish that I could give it back, that I would give it back
   in a second if it meant I could have one more day with
   him, but I can't and that's my life and I deal with it. So
   don't put your shit on me, when you're the one that's
   afraid.

				WILL
   I'm afraid? Wha--wha--what am I afraid of, huh? What
   the fuck am I afraid of?

				SKYLAR
   You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you
   back. And you know what? I'm afraid too. Fuck it. I
   want to give it a shot and at least I'm honest with you.

				WILL
   I'm not honest with you?

				SKYLAR
   No, what about your twelve brothers?

				WILL
   All right.

				SKYLAR
   No. You're not going. You're not leaving.

				WILL
   What do you want to know? What? That I don't have
   twelve brothers?

				SKYLAR
   Yes.

				WILL
   That I'm a fuckin' orphan!

				SKYLAR
   Ye

				WILL
   No, you don't wanna hear that!

				SKYLAR
   I didn't know that.

				WILL
   No, you don't wanna hear that.

				SKYLAR
   I didn't know it.

				WILL
	You don't wanna hear that I had fuckin' cigarettes put
	out on me when I was a little kid.

				SKYLAR
	Oh...I didn't know that...

				WILL
	That this isn't fuckin' surgery, that the motherfucker
	stabbed me. You don't wanna hear that shit, Skylar.

				SKYLAR
	I do wanna hear it.

				WILL
	Don't tell me you want to hear that shit!

				SKYLAR
	I want to hear it because I want to help you. Because I
	want to--

				WILL
	Help me! What the fuck? What I got a fucking sign on
	my back? That says "save me?"

				SKYLAR
	No.

				WILL
	Do I look like I need that?

				SKYLAR
	No. God, I just want to be with you because I love you!

				WILL
	Don't bullshit me. Don't bullshit me. Don't you fuckin'
	bullshit me!

				SKYLAR
	I love you. I wanna hear you say that you don't love me.
	Because if you say that, then I won't call you, and I
	won't be in your life...

				WILL
	I don't love you.Lambeau's Office

				TOM
   Most people never get to see how brilliant they can be.
   They don't find teachers that believe in them. They get
   convinced they're stupid. I hope you appreciate what
   he's doing. Because I've seen how much he enjoys
   working with you. Not against you.

				LAMBEAU
   Hello, Will. Tom, can you get us some coffee?

				TOM
   Sure.

				LAMBEAU
   Well, let's see.....Good...This is correct. I see you used
   McLauren here.

				WILL
   Yeah, I dunno what they call it, but...

				LAMBEAU
   This can't be right. It would be very embarrassing. Did
   you ever consider--

				WILL
   I'm pretty sure it's right. Hey look, can we do this at
   Sean's office from now on, because I--I gotta' knock off
   work to come here and the commute is killin' me.

				LAMBEAU
   Yeah sure. But did you think of the possibility--

				WILL
   It's right. It's right. Just take it home with you.

				LAMBEAU
   What happened at the McNeil meeting?

				WILL
   Oh, I couldn't go. I had a date. So uh...so, I sent my
   chief negotiator.

				LAMBEAU
   On your own time you can do whatever you like, Will,
   but when I set up a meeting with my...with my
   associates, and you don't show up, it reflects poorly on
   me.

				WILL
   All right. Well then don't set up any more meetin's.

				LAMBEAU
   Well, I won't. I'll cancel them. I'll give you a job
   myself. I-I just wanted you to see what was out there.

				WILL
   Look. Maybe I don't want to spend the rest of my
   fuckin' life sittin' around explaining shit to people.

				LAMBEAU
   I think you could show me some appreciation.

				WILL
   A little appreciation? Do you know how easy this is for
   me? Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy this is? This
   is a fuckin' joke. And I'm sorry you can't do this. I
   really am because I wouldn't have to fuckin' sit here and
   watch you fumble around and fuck it up.

				LAMBEAU
   Then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk
   instead, wouldn't you?

				WILL
   You're right. This is probably a total waste of my time.

				LAMBEAU
   You're right, Will. I can't do this proof. But you can,
   and when it comes to that it's only about..it's just a
   handful of people in the world who can tell the
   difference between you and me. But I'm one of them.

				WILL
   Sorry.

				LAMBEAU
   Yeah, so am I. Most days I wish I never met you.
   Because then I could sleep at night, and I wouldn't...and
   I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that
   there's someone like you out there......... And I didn't
   have to watch you throw it all away.........Chuckie's House

				CHUCKIE
   Bill, hold it. You hear that? Morgan! If you're watching
   pornos in my mom's room again I'm gunna give you a
   fuckin' beatin'!

				MORGAN
		 (out of breath)
   What's up fella's

				BILLY
   Morgan, why don't you jerk off in your own fuckin'
   house. That's fuckin' filthy.

				MORGAN
   Well, I don't have a VCR at my house?

				CHUCKIE
   Com'on...not in my glove.

				MORGAN
   I don't use the glove.

				CHUCKIE
   That's my little league glove.

				MORGAN
   Then what am I gunna' do?

				CHUCKIE
   I mean, what's wrong with you? You hump a baseball
   glove?

				MORGAN
   I--I just used it for the..for cleanup.

				CHUCKIE
   Stop jerkin' off in my mother's room! Please!

				MORGAN
   Is there another VCR in the house?

				CHUCKIE
   That's just sad, bro.NSA Interview

				WILL
   So, why do you think I should work for the National
   Security Agency?

				NSA AGENT
   Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be
   exposed to the kind of technology that you wouldn't see
   anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string
   theory, chaos math, advanced algorithms...

				WILL
   Code-breaking.

				NSA AGENT
   Well, that's one aspect of what we do.

				WILL
   Oh, com'on, I mean, that is what you do. You guys
   handle 80 percent of the intelligence workload. You're
   seven times the size of the CIA.

				NSA AGENT
   We don't like to brag about that, Will. So, the way I see
   it, the question isn't Why SHOULD you work for the
   NSA? The question is: Why shouldn't you?

				WILL
   Why shouldn't I work for the NSA? That's a tough one.
   But I'll take a shot. Say I'm working at the NSA, and
   somebody puts a code on my desk, somethin' no one else
   can break. Maybe I take a shot at it and maybe I break
   it. And I'm real happy with myself, cus' I did my job
   well. But maybe that code was the location of some
   rebel army in...

Sean's Office

				WILL
   ...North Africa or the Middle East and once they have
   that location, they bomb the village where the rebels are
   hiding... Fifteen hundred people that I never met, never
   had no problem with get killed. Now the politicians are
   sayin', "Oh, Send in the marines to secure the area" cus'
   they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid over there,
   gettin' shot. Just like it wasn't them when their number
   got called, cus' they were off pullin' a tour in the National
   Guard. It'll be some kid from Southie over there takin'
   shrapnel in the ass. He comes back to find that the plant
   he used to work at got exported to the country he just
   got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his
   ass got his old job, cus' he'll work for fifteen cents a day
   and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile he realizes the only
   reason he was over there in the first place was so that
   we could install a government that would sell us oil at a
   good price. And of course the oil companies used the
   little skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices.
   A cute little ancillary benefit for them but it ain't
   helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. They're takin'
   their sweet time bringin' the oil back, of course, maybe
   even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who
   likes to drink martinis and fuckin' play slalom with the
   icebergs, it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil
   and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic. So now
   my buddy's out of work. He can't afford to drive, so
   he's walking to the fuckin' job interviews, which sucks
   because the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic
   hemorrhoids. And meanwhile he's starvin' cus' every
   time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue plate
   special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with
   Quaker State. So what did I think? I'm holdin' out for
   somethin' better. I figure fuck it, while I'm at it why not
   just shoot my buddy, take his job, give it to his sworn
   enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby
   seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard? I
   could be elected President.

				SEAN
   You feel like you're alone, Will?                        WILL
   What?

				SEAN
   Do you have a soul mate?

				WILL
   Define that.

				SEAN
   Somebody who challenges you.

				WILL
	I have Chuckie.

				SEAN
	You know, Chuckie's family, he'd lie down in fuckin'
	traffic for you. I'm talking about someone who opens
	up things for you. Touches your soul.

				WILL
	I got..I got..

				SEAN
	Who?

				WILL
	I got plenty.

				SEAN
	Well, name 'em.

				WILL
	Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost, o'Conner, Kant, Pope,
	Locke...

				SEAN
	That's great. They're all dead.

				WILL
	Not to me, they're not.

				SEAN
	Yeah, but you don't have a lot of dialog with them. You
	can't give back to them, Will.

				WILL
	Well, not without some serious smelling salts and a
	heater.

				SEAN
	Yeah. Well, that's what I'm saying. You'll never have
	that kind of a relationship in a world where you're
	always afraid to take the first step because all you see is
	every negative thing ten miles down the road.

				WILL
	What? You're going to take the professor's side on this?

				SEAN
	Don't give me a line of shit. No.

				WILL
	Look. I didn't want the job.

				SEAN
	It's not about the job. I don't care if you work for the
	government. But you can do anything you want, you are
	bound by nothing. What are you passionate about. What
	do you want? I mean there are guys who work their
	entire lives laying brick so that their kids have a chance
	at the opportunities you have here.

				WILL
	I didn't ask for this.

				SEAN
	No. You were born with it. So, don't cop out behind "I
	didn't ask for this."

				WILL
	What do you mean "cop out?" I mean, w-w-what's
	wrong with layin' brick?

				SEAN
	Nothing.

				WILL
	There's nothing wrong---That's some-- That's
	somebody's home I'm building.

				SEAN
	Right. My dad laid brick. Okay? Busted his ass so I
	could have an education.

				WILL
	Exactly. That's an honorable profession. What's wrong
	with..with fixing somebody's car. Someone can get to
	work the next day because of me. There's honor in that.

				SEAN
	Yeah, there is, Will. There is honor in that. And there's
	honor in, you know, taking that forty minute train ride
	so those (college kids come) in the morning and the
	floors are clean and the wastebaskets are empty. That's
	real work.

				WILL
	That's right.

				SEAN
	Right. And that's honorable. I'm sure that's why you
	took that job, I mean, for the honor of it. I just have a
	little question here. You could be a janitor anywhere.
	Why did you work at the most prestigious technical
	college in the whole fuckin' world? And why did you
	sneak around at night and finish other people's formulas
	that only one or two people in the world could do, and
	then lie about it? Cus' I don't see a lot of honor in that,
	Will. So, what do you really want to do?

				WILL
	I wanna' be a shepherd.

				SEAN
	Really.

				WILL
	I wanna move up to Nashua get a nice little spread get
	some sheep and tend to them.

				SEAN
	Maybe you should go do that.

				WILL
	What?

				SEAN
	You know, if you're going to jerk off, why don't you
	just do it at home with a moist towel?

				WILL
	You're chuckin' me?

				SEAN
	Yeah, get the fuck out.

				WILL
	Hey, no, no, no. Time's not up, yet.

				SEAN
	Yeah it is.

				WILL
	I'm not leavin'. No!

				SEAN
	Listen. You're not going to answer my questions, you're
	wasting my fuckin' time.

				WILL
	What? I thought we were friends. Whadoyou mean
	you--

				SEAN
	Playtime's over, okay?

				WILL
	Well, why're you kickin' me out, Sean? I mean, what? I
	mean...you're lecturing me on life? Look at you, you
	fuckin' burnout. What winds your clock?

				SEAN
	Workin' with you.

				WILL
	Where's your soul mate? You wanna talk about soul
	mates? Where is she?

				SEAN
	Dead.

				WILL
	That's right, she's fuckin' dead. She fuckin' dies and you
	just cash in your chips and you walk away?

				SEAN
	Hey, at least I played a hand.

				WILL
	Oh...You played a hand and you lost. You lost a big
	fuckin' hand and some people lose a big hand like that
	and have the sack to ante up again.

				SEAN
	Look at me. What do you wanna do? You and your
	bullshit. You got a bullshit answer for everybody. But I
	ask you a very simple question and you can't give me a
	straight answer. Because you don't know. See you, bo
	peep.

				WILL
	Fuck you.

				SEAN
   You're the shepherd......Shepherd...Fuckin' Prick.

Phone Booth and Skylar's Room

				WILL
   I just wanted to, you know, uh...call you up uh...before
   you left. Um..I've been takin' all these uh..job interviews
   and stuff, so..I'm not going to be just a construction
   worker.

				SKYLAR
   Well, you know, I never really cared about that.

				WILL
   Yeah.

				SKYLAR
   I love you. . . . .Will?

				WILL
   Take care.

				SKYLAR
   Bye.

				CHUCKIE
   Will! Will, that's it! We're done!

Sean's Office

				LAMBEAU
   I'm sitting in your office and the boy isn't here....Well,
   it's ten past five....And hour and ten minutes
   late?....Well, what if he doesn't show up and I file a
   report saying he wasn't here and he goes back to jail, it
   won't be on my conscience....Okay. Fine.

				CHUCKIE
   What's up?

				WILL
   Thanks.

				CHUCKIE
   That's good...So, how's your lady?

				WILL
   Eh..she's gone.

				CHUCKIE
   Gone? Gone where?

				WILL
   Uh, med school. Medical school in California.

				CHUCKIE
   Really?

				WILL
   Yeah.

				CHUCKIE
   When was this?

				WILL
   It was like a week ago.

				CHUCKIE
   Well, that sucks.  So uh...when're you done with
   those meetin's?

				WILL
   I think the week after I'm 21.

				CHUCKIE
   Yeah, they gunna' hook you up with a job, or what?

				WILL
   Yeah. Fuckin' sit in a room and do long division for the
   next fifty years.

				CHUCKIE
   eh..probably make some nice bank, though.

				WILL
   I'm gonna be a fuckin' lab rat.

				CHUCKIE
   Better than this shit. It's a way outta' here.

				WILL
   What do I want a way out of here for? I mean, I'm gunna
   fuckin' live here the rest of my life. You know, we'll be
   neighbors, you know, we'll have little kids fuckin' take
   'em to little league together up at Foley field.

				CHUCKIE
   Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong
   way. In twenty years, if you're still livin' here, comin'
   over to my house to watch the Patriots games, still
   workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. That's not a
   threat. Now, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.

				WILL
   What the fuck are you talkin' about?

				CHUCKIE
   Look. You got somethin' none of us--

				WILL
   Oh come on..Wh--Why is it always this, I mean, I fuckin'
   owe it to myself to do this..why if I don't want to.

				CHUCKIE
   All right. No. No no. Fuck you. You don't owe it to
   yourself. You owe it to me. Cus' tomorrow I'm gonna
   wake up and I'll be fifty. And I'll still be doin' this shit.
   And that's all right, that's fine. I mean, you're sitting on
   a winnin' lottery ticket. And you're too much of a pussy
   to cash it in. And that's bullshit. Cus' I'd do fuckin'
   anything to have what you got. So would any of these
   fuckin' guys. it'd be an insult to us if you're still here in
   twenty years. Hanging around here is a fuckin' waste of
   your time.

				WILL
   You don't know that.

				CHUCKIE
   I don't?

				WILL
   No. You don't know that.

				CHUCKIE
   Oh I don't know that. Let me tell you what I do know.
   Every day I come by your house and I pick you up. And
   we go out, we have a few drinks, and a few laughs, and
   it's great. But you know what the best part of my day is?
   It's for about ten seconds from when I pull up to the curb
   to when I get to your door. Because I think maybe I'll
   get up there and I'll knock on the door and you won't be
   there. No goodbye, no see you later, no nothin'. Just left.
   I don't know much, but I know that. Sean's Office

				LAMBEAU
   This is a disaster, Sean. I brought you in here because I
   wanted you to help me with the boy. Not to run him out.

				SEAN
   I know what I'm doing with the boy.

				LAMBEAU
   I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy. I don't
   care if you have a few laughs even at my expense, but
   don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.

				SEAN
   Undermine?

				LAMBEAU
   This boy is at a fragile point right now.

				SEAN
   I do understnd. He is at a fragile point, okay? He's got
   problems.

				LAMBEAU
   Well, what problems does he have, Sean? That he's better
   off as a janitor? That he's better off in jail? Better off
   hanging out with a bunch of retarded gorillas?

				SEAN
   Oh, why do you think he does that, Gerry? Do you have
   any fuckin' clue why? Hmm?

				LAMBEAU
   He can handle the problems. he can handle the work. And
   he obviously handled you.

				SEAN
   Gerry listen to me. Listen to me. Why is he hiding? Why
   doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that
   happened to him, he was abandoned by the people who
   were supposed to love him most.

				LAMBEAU
   Oh, come on, don't give me that Freudian crap.

				SEAN
   Aw, now listen, Gerry. And why does he hang out with
   those retarded gorillas, as you call them? Because any
   one of them, if he asked them to, would take a fuckin' bat
   to your head, okay? That's called loyalty.

				LAMBEAU
	Yeah, that's very touching.

				SEAN
	And who's he handling? He pushes people away before
	they have a chance to leave him. It's a defense
	mechanism, all right? And for twenty years he's been
	alone because of that. And if you push him right now,
	it's going to be the same thing all over again, and I'm
	not gunna let that happen to him.

				LAMBEAU
	Now, don't you do that, Sean.

				SEAN
	What, Gerry?

				LAMBEAU
	Don't you do that. Don't infect him with the idea that
	it's okay to quit, that it's okay to be a failure because it's
	not okay, Sean. And if you're angry at me for
	being..being successful, for being what you could have
	been, Sean..

				SEAN
	I'm not angry at you, Gerry.

				LAMBEAU
	Oh, yes, you're angry at me, Sean. You resent me. But
	I'm not going to apologize for any...any success I've
	had. You're angry at me for doing what you could have
	done, but ask yourself, Sean, ask yourself if you want
	Will to feel that way, if you want him to feel like a
	failure..

				SEAN
	Oh, you arrogant shit. That's why I don't come to the
	goddamnned reunions. Cus' I can't stand that look in
	your eye. You know? That condescending, embarrassed
	look.

				LAMBEAU
	Aw, come one, Sean.

				SEAN
	You think I'm a failure. I know who I am, and I'm
	proud of what I do. It was a conscious choice. I didn't
	fuck up. And you and your cronies think I'm sort of
	pity case. You and your kiss ass chorus, following you
	around going, "The Fields Medal, The Fields Medal."
	Why are you still so fuckin' afraid of failure?

				LAMBEAU
	It's about my medal, is it? Oh God, I can go home and
	get it for you. You can have it.

				SEAN
	You please don't, you know--

				LAMBEAU
	I mean that--

				SEAN
	You know what, Gerry? Shove the medal up your
	fuckin' ass, all right? Cus' I don't give a shit about your
	medal because I knew you before you were a
	mathematical god. When you were pimple-faced and
	homesick, and didn't know what side of the bed to piss
	on.

				LAMBEAU
	Yeah, you were smarter than me then and you're
	smarter than me now. So, don't blame me for how your
	life turned out it's not my fault.

				SEAN
	I don't blame you! It's not about you, you mathematical
	dick! It's about the boy! He's a good kid, and I won't see
	you fuck him up like you're trying to fuck up me right
	now. I won't see you make him feel like a failure too.

				LAMBEAU
	He won't be a failure, Sean!

				SEAN
	But if you push him, Gerry. If you ride him.

				LAMBEAU
	Seeeaaaan. I am what I am today because I was pushed
	and because I learned to push myself.

				SEAN
	He's not you, you get that?

				WILL
	I can...come back.

				LAMBEAU
	No come in. uh...I was just leaving.

				SEAN
	A lot of that stuff goes back a long way between me and
	him. You know...it's not about you.

				WILL
	What is that?

				SEAN
	This is your file. I hafta' send it back to the judge for
	evaluation.

				WILL
	Hey, you're not gunna fail me, are you? What's it say?

				SEAN
	Wanna read it?

				WILL
	Why?...Have you had any uh...experience with that?

				SEAN
	Twenty years of counseling. Yeah, I've seen some pretty
	awful shit.

				WILL
	I mean have you had any..experience with that?

				SEAN
	Personally? yeah...Yeah I have.

				WILL
	It sure ain't good.

				SEAN
	My father was an alcoholic. Mean fuckin' drunk. He'd
	come home hammered, lookin' to wail on somebody.
	So, I had to provoke him so he wouldn't go after my
	mother and little brother. Interesting nights were when
	he wore his rings.

				WILL
	Yeah...he used to just put a uh...a wrench, a stick, and a
	belt on the table, and just say choose.

				SEAN
	Well, I gotta' go with the belt there, Vanna.

				WILL
	Uh..well, I used to go with the wrench.

				SEAN
	Why the wrench?

				WILL
	cus' Fuck him, that's why.

				SEAN
	Your foster father?

				WILL
	Yeah. So uh...you know, what is it? Like, Will has an
	attachment disorder? Is it all that stuff? Fear of
	abandonment? Is that why uh...Is that why I broke up
	with Skylar?

				SEAN
	I didn't know you had.

				WILL
	Yeah...I did.

				SEAN
	You wanna talk about it?

				WILL
	No...

				SEAN
	Hey, Will? I don't know a lot. But you see this? All this
	shit. It's not your fault.

				WILL
	Yeah, I know that.

				SEAN
	Look at me, son. It's not your fault.

				WILL
	I know.

				SEAN
	It's not your fault.

				WILL
	I know.

				SEAN
   No, no, you don't. It's not your fault.

				WILL
   I know.

				SEAN
   It's not your fault.

				WILL
   All right.

				SEAN
   It's not your fault. It's not your fault.

				WILL
   Don't fuck with me.

				SEAN
   It's not your fault.

				WILL
   Don't fuck with me all right? Don't fuck with me,
   Sean, not you.

				SEAN
   It's not your fault...It's not your fault...

				WILL
		 (through heavy sobbing)
   Oh God....Oh God, I'm so sorry...                        SEAN
   Fuck them, okay?
