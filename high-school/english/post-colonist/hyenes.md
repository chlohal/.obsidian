## Cultural Colonization
*The continued postcolonial influence of European education, culture, values, laws, etc. on formerly colonized people*
- Coca-Cola in the ~~bar~~ grocery store
- The Western fans, air conditioners, etc. that Ramatou brings in
- 

## Eurocentrism
*The use of European culture as the standard to which all cultures are negatively contrasted*


## Orientalism
*The creation of a positive national self-definition for Western nations by contrast with Eastern nations, which the West projects negative characteristics on*


## Colonial Subjects
*Colonized persons who did not resist colonial subjugation because they were taught to believe in European superiority, and therefore, in their own inferiority*
- The scene where everyone's marvelling at the refrigerators, air conditioners, etc.
- Ramatou herself?

## Mimicry
*The act of colonial subjects who imitate their colonizers, as much as possible, in dress, speech, behaviour, and lifestyle. Mimcry reflects both the desire of colonized individuals to be accepted by the colonizing culture and the shame experienced by colonized individuals concerning their own culture, which they were programmed to see as inferior*


## Unhomeliness
*Being unhomed is not the same as being homeless. To be unhomed is to feel not-at-home, even in your own home because you are not at home in yourself: your cultural identity crisis has made you a psychological refugee, so to speak*


## Double Consciousness
*A consciousness or way of perceiving the world that is divided between two antagonistic cultures: that of the colonizer and that of the indigenous community. A negative mental state.*
- Dramaan's grocery store being raided
- The yellow shoes?

## Hybridity
*A constantly evolving hybrid of native and colonial cultures... a productive, exciting, positive force in a shrinking world that is itself becoming more and more culturally hybrid. A positive mental state.*


## Nativism
*An attempt to assert a native culture and to reduce Western influences*


## Neocolonialism
*Control of formerly colonized nations' economic and political interests by international corporations, who exploit the cheap labor available in developing countries, often at the expense of those countries' own struggling businesses, cultural traditions, and ecological well-being*


## Cultural Imperialism
*The takeover of one culture by another: the food, clothing, customs, recreation, and values of the economically dominant culture increasingly replaces those of the economically vulnerable culture until the latter appears to be a kind of imitation of the former.*
- None of the children of Columbane "do anything"
