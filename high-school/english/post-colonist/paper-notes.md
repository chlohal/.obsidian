## Thought Number 1

Write it for Option 2 with TFA and Columbite Tantalite.

- easy
- the easiest option
- not particularly original
	- then again, it's third term senior year
- **The texts *Things Fall Apart* and *Columbite Tantalite* both tell stories about the comp** --
- ==at this point, b. herrmann came over to talk.==
	- time difference
	- compare/contrast both 
	- it's not easy!
- ok, fair
- i'll come back to this in a bit.
---
- ok, i'm back.
- **Columbite Tantalite and Things Fall Apart both tell stories about how African cultures fall to colonialism, but while Things Fall Apart focuses on the attributes of African culture that allow this to happen, Columbite Tantalite focuses on the parts of human nature that encourage it.**



## Thought Number 2

Write it for Option 1 with Columbite Tantalite and Hyenes.

- power dynamic-- both feature characters that 'fight back' against those who have wronged them using colonial power
	- Sese w/ chef (talk about how he treats his driver, etc)
	- Ramatou w/ Draaman (talk about cultural imperialism, how her history as being *from* the town makes it different, etc)
- yeah, that's cool, but **how do they contend with the challenges of postcolonial identity?**
	- CT
		- Sese is a betrayer
			- `this is not a new observation.`
		- ==Talk about the game developer character? A considerable amount of time is spent on him.==
			- yeah, but *what?*
			- What does the director try to say with him?
			- May be ignored for now.
		- 
	- Hyenes
		- Contrasts power through colonialism vs. power of colonized civilisation -- dramaan is "one of the most popular personalities in Columbane", but he's decried and murdered.
		- "we won't kill him; we have ideals"-- culture is disregarded by westernized people
			- again, discuss how she's been victimized by *their* culture-- *nobody* is in the right, here!
		- "Richer than the World Bank"



## Thought Number 3

sidecar argument about the responsibilities of the author vs responsibilities of the reader. "TFA is about poverty!" -- no!! okonkwo's *rich!* what even *is* a postcolonial view-- is The Wedding Party even... a postcolonial text??? i mean, we'll have to see ofc, but i could write a whole bunch about like, the hubris of interperting texts in a postcolonial sense when they shouldn't be.

> The Death of the Author theory states that, after a text is finished, an author's views should not be considered: only the text itself is important.

## Based on Brian Herrmann Suggestion: Thought 3 Blend w/ Thought 1

**Columbite Tantalite's and Things Fall Apart's authors tell stories African cultures falling to colonialism, but are also examples of colonial beliefs themselves. While Things Fall Apart focuses on the attributes of African culture that allow this to happen, Columbite Tantalite focuses on the parts of human nature that encourage it.**

> [!help] hmm
> Too broad. Two different theses welded together. Try to get a homozygous mix.

**The film *Columbite Tantalite* and the novel *Things Fall Apart* both tell stories about African colonialism, differing in their approach;** . 

---

==oh my god i can work the game developer into this!==

---

**The film *Columbite Tantalite* and the novel *Things Fall Apart* both tell stories about African colonialism, differing in their approach; while *Things Fall Apart* strikes a balance between an authentic Igbo story and a Western one, *Columbite Tantalite* reaches towards Western cultures**.

> [!help] 5/10
> - sounds like TFA is better than CT
> - bad
> - why?
>    - "authentic"
> 	 - "reaches"
> - fix 

**The film *Columbite Tantalite* and the novel *Things Fall Apart* tell stories about African colonism, but while *Columbite Tantalite* prioritizes reaching Western viewers, *Things Fall Apart* tries to affect both cultures in a measured fashion.**

> [!help] :/
> - "both cultures"
> - do we need to specify that it's a film/novel?

***Columbite Tantalite* and *Things Fall Apart* tell stories about African colonism, but while *Columbite Tantalite* prioritizes reaching Western viewers, *Things Fall Apart* holds the Western perspective at arm's length.**

> [!help] no metaphors in your thesis!

***Columbite Tantalite* and *Things Fall Apart* tell stories about African colonism, but while *Columbite Tantalite* prioritizes reaching Western viewers, *Things Fall Apart* keeps the Western perspective secondary.**

ok. this is writeable. i think. 3 body paragraphs; 1 CT, 1 TFA, and (maybe, if i have time/energy) 1 blend.
