# justice

## how characters see justice

john: things are maleable. "sure, we can start over & make your grades better"
carol: things are strict; the ends justify the means. "you deserve to get fired bc even if *this* case was exaggerated, there are other cases which justify it."

paul: things are maleable. "I didn't know the boy killed himself. He gave me the money" (97). Unwilling to take responsibility. Like John? 
- Yes, since he supports fluidity, resistance of norms
- No, since he's 
		wait 
		how isn't he?
		well, i can't say "the author's intent in writing these two plays", since they're by different people. the closest thing would be "oh, mr herrmann put these two plays together to make a statement about how empathy affects justice", and i can't say that :/
		anyway, reasons why paul is dissimilar to john:
	- Self-made
	- Not from a high-society place of birth
	- Less privileged
	- an empathetic figure to the audience
		- is that my bias????
ouisa: in-between. Wants paul to go to jail, but connects with him; wants him to be her son.
flan: wants paul to go to jail. calls him a "crook". says ouisa is too empathetic towards him.

## how the authors portray justice

Mamet: Justice is a way to make sure that powerful people get what they deserve. Inversion of control means that the students can enforce things to make sure that the teachers are being good. This is a good thing, since John's rageful and sexist behaviour was exposed.

Guare: There are situations in which nuance is needed. On the other hand, the empathy of victims might stand in the way of justice required (e.g. Paul caused Rick's death, but says this is unintentional; still, Ouisa wants to rescue him). The portrayal of justice as a 


Both authors ask the audience to consider the consequences of justice, but while Mamet's *Oleana* somethingsomething John isn't a sympathetic figure but Paul is? 

Mamet's oleana portrays John as an unsympathetic figure, but Paul is shown to be empathetic. 

Oleana portrays blind justice as important and rightful, while *Six Degrees* shows blind justice as obstructive and uncompromisable.



guare has the rainbow room sequence to show how paul's not a perfect person, but his empathy and charisma carry him through, while john lacks that.

but they both die in the end!

ohohoohohoho

Paul is okay with being turned in. he feels guilt for causing rick's death and wants to learn a real job. meanwhile, 

relate to blm?


Paul and Carol both seek social justice in underhanded ways because they see themselves as the 'underdogs'. However, only Carol succeeds because of the privileged qualities that she was fighting against. Mamet and Guare both show stories of characters trying to fight against 'the man' for justice, but
