A sculptor uses a constant volume of modeling clay to form a cylinder with a large height and a relatively small radius. The clay is modeled in such a way that the height of the clay increases as the radius decreases, but it retains its cylindrical shape. At time t=c, the height of the clay is 8 inches, the radius of the clay is 3 inches, and the radius of the clay is decreasing at a rate of $\frac{1}{2}$ inch per minute.

At what rate is the area of the cross section of the clay decreasing with respect to time?
$V = \pi r^2 h$
$V = \pi r^2 h$
$V = \pi r^2 h$

$C(t) = \pi r^2$
$V = \pi r^2 h$
$\frac{V}{\pi r^2} = h$

$\frac{0*(\pi r^2) - V\pi2r\frac{dr}{dt}}{(\pi r^2)^2} = \frac{dh}{dt}$

$\frac{-V\pi2r\frac{dr}{dt}}{(\pi r^2)^2} = \frac{dh}{dt}$
$\frac{-V\pi2r\frac{-1}{2}}{(\pi r^2)^2} = \frac{dh}{dt}$
$\frac{V\pi r}{(\pi r^2)^2} = \frac{dh}{dt}$
$\frac{V\pi r}{\pi^2 r^4} = \frac{dh}{dt}$
$\frac{V}{\pi r^3} = \frac{dh}{dt}$
$\frac{V}{\pi r^3} = \frac{dh}{dt}$
$\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{V}{\pi r^3}$
$t = c, \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{\pi r^2 h}{\pi r^3}$
$t = c, \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{h}{r}$
$t = c, \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{8}{3}$
