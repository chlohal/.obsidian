1. $v(t) = 2t - 6$
2. 
```desmos-graph
y = 2t - 6
```

a. A negative velocity means the ladybug is walking backwards
b. A positive velocity means the ladybug is walking forwards

3. $t=3$-- $v(t) = 0$
4. 
    a. $v(t)$ is -4 yards per minute.
    b. $v'(1) = 2$. This means that the ladybug's acceleration is 2 yards per minute per minute.
	c. It is slowing down, because the velocity is approaching 0
1. $s(t) = -2t^2 + 3t + c$

**Important Takeaways**

*Position*: $s(t)$
*Velocity*: $v(t) = s'(t)$
*Acceleration*: $a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t)$

If the object is at rest, $v(t) = 0$. If the object is moving right/up, $v(t) > 0$. If the object is moving left/down, $v(t) < 0$



$v(t) > 0, a(t) > 0$: Speeding Up
$v(t) > 0, a(t) < 0$: Slowing Down
$v(t) < 0, a(t) > 0$: Slowing Down
$v(t) < 0, a(t) < 0$: Speeding Up


As he falls, the Emperor's position is given in feet by $s(t) = -16t^2 + 16t - 320$, where $t$ is the amount of seconds since he fell.
a. $s(2) - s(1)$
	$-32$
b. $s(x) = 0$
	$x = 5{s}$	
c. $s'(5) = v(5)$
	$v(t) = -32t + 16$
	$v(t) = -160 + 16 = -144 {f/s}$
d. 144 feet per second
e. $a(t) = -32$ in feet per second per second


3. 
	a. The object is at rest at t=5 seconds, because the velocity is 0.
	b. It is speeding up because the velocity is approaching infinity. Both the acceleration and velocity are positive.
4. $v(t) = \frac{1}{\pi} + sin(3t)$
	$a(t) = 3cos(3t)$
	$3 = 3cos(3t), \frac{\pi}{2} \leqq t \leqq \pi$
	$1 = cos(3t), \frac{\pi}{2} \leqq t \leqq \pi$
	$t = \frac{2}{3}pi$
	$v(\frac{2}{3}pi) = \frac{1}{\pi} + sin(2pi)$
	$v(\frac{2}{3}pi) = \frac{1}{\pi} + 0$
	$v(\frac{2}{3}pi) = \frac{1}{\pi}$
	
	When the acceleration is 3, the velocity is $\frac{1}{\pi}$
