1. A particle starts at $x=0$ and moves along the x-axis so that its velocity at time $t$ is given by $v(t) = -(t+1)\sin(\frac{t^2}{2})$
	1. $v'(t) = a(t) =(-1)\sin(\frac{t^2}{2}) + -(t+1)(t\cos(0.5t^2))$
		$a(2) = 1.5875$
	2. $C_d = \{2.507\}$; this is the only $t$ in $(0,3)$ for which $v(t) = 0$
	3. $\int\limits_{0}^{3}|v(t)|dt = 4.3338$
	4. $\int_{0}^{2.507}|v(t)|dt = 3.265$
2. 
	1. $-23$cm
	2. $33$cm
	3. $11$cm; $16$cm; $-8$cm
	4. $t=a$
	5. $t=c$
