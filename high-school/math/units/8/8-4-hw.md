1. Find the area of the region bounded by the graphs of $y=x^2+x+2$, $y=-x$, $x=0$, and $x=2$. Sketch the curves, set-up the integral, and give the answer.
	```desmos-graph
	x=0
	x=2
	y=x^2+x+2
	y=-x
	```
		$\int_0^2 (x^2 + x + 2 - -x) dx$
		$\int_0^2 (x^2 + x + 2 + x) dx$
		$\int_0^2 (x^2 + 2x + 2) dx$
		$10.6666$
2. Find the area of the region bounded by the graphs of $y=6-x^2$ and $y=x$. Find the points of intersection, sketch the curves, set up the integral, and solve.
	```desmos-graph
	y=6-x^2
	y=x
	```
	$6-x^2 = x \implies x= {2,-3}$ 
	$\int_{-3}^2 (6 - x^2 - x) dx$
	$20.8333$
3. $\int_{-0.75pi}^{0.25pi} (\cos(x) - \sin(x)) dx$
	$\sin(x) + \cos(x) |_{-0.75pi}^{0.25pi}$
	$\sin(x) + \cos(x) |_{-0.75pi}^{0.25pi}$
	$2\sqrt{2}$
4. Find the area of the region by the graphs of $y=2x^3 - x^2 - 14x$ and $y=4x-x^2$
	$81$
