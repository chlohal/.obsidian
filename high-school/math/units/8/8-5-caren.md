1. $-0.1$ miles per minute squared
2. $\int_0^{12} |v(t)| dt$ is the total distance that she traveled; it is $1.8$ miles.
3. She turns around at $t=2$min, since this is when $v(t) = 0$
4. $D_c = \int_0^{12} v(t) dt = 1.4$
	$w(t) = \frac{\pi}{15} \sin(\frac{\pi}{12}t)$
	 $D_l = \int_0^{12} w(t)dt = 1.6$
	 Caren lives closer to school because $D_l > D_c$
