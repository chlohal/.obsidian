The first question is "summarize when, how, who, why, and what of one of our important experiments"

There'll be 1-2 open response for each unit. In each one, you'll get options (e.g. "answer two of these $x$ questions")
There'll be 3 or 4 calculation-type questions. Topics include (but are not limited to) waves, double slit, time dilation, length contraction, electric/magnetic fields, the photoelectric effect.

We get all of the equations, but we *don't* get all the symbols and the meanings of the equations (i.e. word bank). We get **this exactly:**

> $q \Delta V = \Delta E P E$
> $KE = \frac12 mv^2$
> $n_1\sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)$
> $\lambda = x \frac d L$
> $\lambda_n = 2 \frac L n$
> $T = \frac 1 f$
> $v = \lambda f$
> $v = d/t$
> $1$nm = $1*10^{-9}$m
> $\gamma = \frac 1 {\sqrt{- 1 \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$
> $t = \gamma t_0$
> $m = \gamma m_0$
> $L = \frac {L_0} \gamma$
> $E = mc^2$
> $E = hf$
> $hf = KE_{max} + W_0$
> $q * V_{stop} = KE_{max}$
> $h = 6.63 * 10^{-34}$ Js, or $h = 4.14 * 10^{-15}$ eVs
> $q_{electron} = -1.6 * 10^{-19}$C
In general, all constants except for the speed of light.

We get a 3x5 notecard. We can put whatever we want on it.
