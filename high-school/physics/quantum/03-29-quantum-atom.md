- At the quantum level, things can be in more than one location
- Although they're confusing, every time we've tested these laws, **they've been correct**.


## Bohr Model
Bohr theorized that electrons can only occupy certain orbits. If they're shifting energy levels, then they're "quantized"-- it jumps straight from one orbit to another. This jump is called the "quantum leap".

## Electrons are Waves?

We've already proven that light's a wave, but electrons produce the same thing. THat means that electrons are waves?

Max Bourne said that electrons are *probability* waves; you can't say "the electron is here". You say **"the electron has a 95% probability of being here"**.

## Measurement

Before you measure a particle, it can be anywhere. When you **observe** it, that impossibility collapses.


## Blackbody Radiation

Objects can emit electromagnetic waves for two reasons: either reflecting from a light source, or emitting for itself. For example, humans emit infrared light!

*Blackbody radiation refers to that EM light.*
