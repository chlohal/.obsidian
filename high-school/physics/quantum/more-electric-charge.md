$E = 1.4 * 10^{-12}$N/C
1) How much force would the field between the plates exert on a particle with a charge of $-8 * 10^{-16}$C and mass of $2 * 10^{-29}$kg? What direction would the force be?
	$F_E = e*q$
	$11.2 * 10^{-28}$N upwards
2) fe
3) $\Delta EPE = 0.1 * -8 * 10^{-16} = -8 * 10^{-17}$
4)
