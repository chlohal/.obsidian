$m = m_0\gamma$

$m_0$ is the rest mass. It's the lowest mass possible to measure for an object.
$m$ is the expanded mass.


The Flash has a mass of 100kg when he runs at 0.86c. What's his rest mass?

$\gamma = 2$

$100 = m_0\gamma$
$100 = m_0*2$
$m_0 = 50$


$m_0 = 1.67262192369*10^{-27} kg$

$m = 1.25*10^{-23} kg$

$m = m_0 \gamma$

$\gamma = \frac{m}{m_0}$
$\gamma = 7473.29676$
$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$
$7473.29676 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$
$7473.29676 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$
$0.000133809754 = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$
$1.79050503E-8 = 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}$
$1.79050503E-8 = -\frac{v^2}{c^2} + 1$
$1.79050503E-8 = -\frac{v^2}{c^2} + 1$
$-0.999999982 = -\frac{v^2}{c^2}$
$0.999999982 = \frac{v}{c}^2$
$0.999999982 = \frac{v}{c}^2$
$0.999999991 = \frac{v}{c}$
