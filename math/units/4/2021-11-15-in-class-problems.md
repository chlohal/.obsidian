1. $E(t) = 20 + 15sin(\frac{\pi t}{6})$
$E'(t) = 15\frac{pi}{6}cos(\frac{\pi t}{6})$
$L(t) = 4 + 2^{0.1t^2}$
$L'(t) = ?$

$E'(4) = 15\frac{pi}{6}cos(\frac{4\pi}{6})$
$E'(4) = 15\frac{pi}{6}cos(\frac{4\pi}{6})$
$E'(4) = 15\frac{pi}{6}*-0.5$
$E'(4) = \frac{-7.5pi}{6}$
$E'(4) = \frac{-7.5pi}{6}$
$E'(4) = -1.25\pi$

$L'(4) = 1.86809837$

a) **$E'(4)$ is $-1.25\pi$ and $L'(t)$ is $1.868$. This means that the rate of people entering is decreasing while the rate of people leaving is increasing.**
b) It is decreasing because $\frac{dy}{dx}[E(t) - L(t)](5) = -2.88$. This indicates that people are, on average, leaving at a rate of 2.88 people per hour.


2. $f(t) = 10 + 0.8t*sin(\frac{t^3}{100})$
	$f'(t) = 0.8*sin(\frac{t^3}{100}) + 0.8t*\frac{3}{100}t^2*cos(\frac{t^3}{100})$
  $g(t) = 3 + 2.4ln(t^2 + 2t)$
  $f'(7) = -8.119$. This means that, after the market is open for 7 hours, the tomatoes are being removed (presumably, to buy) at a rate of 8.119 pounds per hour.
  
  $T(t) = (3 + 2.4ln(t^2 + 2t)) - (10 + 0.8t*sin(\frac{t^3}{100}))$
  The amount of tomatoes at $t = 5$ is decreasing because $g(5) - f(5) = -2.263$
