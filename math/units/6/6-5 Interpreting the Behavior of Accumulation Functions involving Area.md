2. $(-3, -1) U (3, 7)$
3. $(-2, 1) U (5,7)$
4. $(-3, -2) U (2, 4)$
5. When the derivative moves from negative to positive  (at $x=-1$)
6. When the derivative moves from positive to negative (at $x=3$)


1c. Use the table from part A to help plot the graph of $y = g(x)$.


## Example 2

The graph of $y = g(x)$ is increasing on $(-4, 7)$ and $(9,10)$ because this is where $f(x) > 0$.

The graph of $y = g(x)$ is decreasing on $(-10, -4)$ and $(7,9)$ because this is where $f(x) < 0$.

The graph of $y = g(x)$ is concave up on $(-8 -6) U (-6, -2) U (0,2) U (8,9)U(9, 10)$ because this is where $f'(x) > 0$.

The graph of $y = g(x)$ is concave down on $(-10 -8) U (-2,0) U (2,4) U (6,7) U (7,-8)$ because this is where $f'(x) < 0$.

## Example 3

|-|-|

|-2|1|
|-1|0|
| 0|-1|
| 1|-1.5|
| 2|-3|
| 3|-5.5|

$g(x)$ is increasing on $(-3,2)$ because this is where $f(x) > 0$
$g(x)$ is increasing on $(-2,0) U (0, 2)$ because this is where $f(x) < 0$
$g(x)$ is concave up on $(-1,0)$ because this is where $f'(x) > 0$
$g(x)$ is concave down on $(-3,-1) U (0, 3)$ because this is where $f'(x) < 0$

$g(x)$ has a relative maximum at $x-2$ because $f(x)$ moves from positive to negative.

$g(x)$ has a point of inflection at $x=-1$ and $x=0$ because $f'(x)$ is undefined.

## Example 4

a) $g(0) = 4.5$; $g'(0) = 1$
b) $g(x)$ attains a relative maximum at $x=3$ because this is the only point where $g'(x)= 0$ and $g''(x) < 0$
c) $g(-4)$ is the absolute minimum on $[-5, 4]$ because $g(-4)$ is the only point where $f(-4) = 0$, $f'(-4) > 0$. $g(-4) = -1$.

|x|g(x)|

|-4|-1|

|4|$6.5 - \frac{\pi}{2}$|

d) $g(x)$ has a point of inflection $\forall x \exists {-3, 1, 2}$
