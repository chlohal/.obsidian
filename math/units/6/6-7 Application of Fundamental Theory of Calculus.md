$$
\int\limits_{a}^{b} g'(x) dx = g(b) - g(a)
$$

Accumulated value = Final Value - Initial Value

## Example 1

The graph of $g'(x)$ is given below. If $g(-2) = -11$, find $g(4)$

$g(-2) = -11$
$\int\limits_{-2}^{4} g'(x) dx = g(4) - g(-2)$
$\int\limits_{-2}^{4} g'(x) dx = g(4) - -11$
$\int\limits_{-2}^{4} g'(x) dx = g(4) + 11$
$2\pi + 2 = g(4) + 11$
$2\pi + 2 = g(4) + 11$
$2\pi - 9 = g(4)$
$2\pi - 9 = g(4)$

## Example 2

The velocity of an object is given by $v(t) = 4\sin(t)$. The position of the object at time $t$ is represented by $x(t)$. It is known that $x(0)=5$. Find $x(0.5\pi)$.

$\int\limits_{0}^{0.5\pi} x'(t) dt = x(0.5\pi) - x(0)$
$\int\limits_{0}^{0.5\pi} 4\sin(t) dt = x(0.5\pi) - x(0)$
$\int\limits_{0}^{0.5\pi} 4\sin(t) dt = x(0.5\pi) - x(0)$
$-4\cos(t) |_{0}^{0.5\pi} = x(0.5\pi) - x(0)$
$0 - -4 = x(0.5\pi) - 5$
$4 = x(0.5\pi) - 5$
$9 = x(0.5\pi)$

## Example 3

The velocity of an object is given by $v(t) = (t^2 + 1)^3$. The opsition of the object, represented by $x(t)$ is $5$ at $t=0$. Find $x(2)$

$\int\limits_{0}^{2} v(t) dt = x(2) - x(0)$
$\int\limits_{0}^{2} v(t) dt = x(2) - x(0)$
$47.485 = x(2) - x(0)$
$47.485 = x(2) - 5$
$52.485 = x(2)$


## Example 4
^t
The population of the United States is growing at a rate of $F'(t) = 287(1.009)^t$ million people per year, where $t$ is the number of years since 2015.

If the population of the United States was 320 million in 2015, whatis the population in 2020?

$\int\limits_{0}^{5} F'(t) dt = P(5) - P(0)$
$\int\limits_{0}^{5} F'(t) dt = P(5) - P(0)$
$\int\limits_{0}^{5} F'(t) dt = P(5) - 320$
$14.676 = P(5) - 320$
$334.676 = P(5)$
