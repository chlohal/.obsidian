Finding the volume of the solid generated by rotating a region about a line. This is easy when you rotate around a line that is **in** the region (i.e. it produces a convex solid), but when the line is **out of the region**, it is more difficult.

*Horizontal Axis of Revolution*
$$
V = (\pi R^2 - \pi r^2)w = \pi(R^2 - r^2)w
$$

> To find the volume of a solid generated by revolution with the washer method, use one of the following:
> **Horizontal Axis:**
> $$V = \pi\int_a^b (R(x)^2 - r(x)^2) dx$$
> **Vertical Axis:**
> $$V = \pi\int_a^b (R(y)^2 - r(y)^2) dy$$

## Example 1

Find the volume of the solid generated by rotating the region bounded by $y=x$, $x=0$, and $y=(x-1)^2 + 1$ about the x-axis

```desmos-graph
y = x
y = (x-1)^2 + 1
```

$R = (x - 1)^2 + 1$
$r = x$


$V = \pi\int_0^1 (((x - 1)^2 + 1)^2 - x^2) dx = 1.53333333\pi = \frac{23}{15}\pi$

## Example 2

Find the volume of the solid generated by rotating the region bounded by $y=\sqrt{x}$, $x=0$, and $y=x^2$ about the y-axis.

$R = \sqrt{y}$
$r = y^2$

$V = \pi\int_0^1 (\sqrt{y}^2 - y^2^2) dy = 0.3\pi$

## Example 3

Let R be the region bounded by the graphs of $y=2x^2$, $y=0$, and $x=2$.

1. Find the volume of the solid generated by revolving $R$ about the x-axis
	$V = \pi\int_0^2 ((2x^2)^2) dx$
	$V = \pi\int_0^2 4x^4 dx$
	$V = \pi \sqrt{4}{5}x^5 |_0^2$
	$V = \frac{128}{5} \pi$
2. $r = x = \sqrt{0.5y}$
	$R = 2$
	$V = \pi \int_0^8 (2^2 - \sqrt{0.5y}^2) dy$
	$V = \pi \int_0^8 (4x - \sqrt{0.5y}^2) dy$
	$V = \pi 4x -0.25y^2 |_0^8$
	$V = \pi 32 - 16 - 0$
	$V = \pi 16$
	$V = 16\pi$

1. Find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by $y=2/x$, $y=3-x$ about the x-axis.
	$\pi\int_1^2 ((3-x)^2 - \frac{2}{x}^2) dx$
	$\frac{1}{3}\pi$
2. Find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by $y=2x$, $y=x^2$ about the y-axis.
	$R = 0.5y$
	$r = \sqrt{y}$
	$V = \pi\int_0^4 (y - (0.5y)^2) dy$
	$V = \pi (0.5y^2 - (0.25y^2)|_0^4 dy$
	$\frac{8}{3}\pi$
3. Find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by $y=x^2$, $x=0$, $y=4$, $y=0$ about the x-axis.
