	1. Let $R$ be the region bounded by the graphs of $y = x^2 - 1$ and $y = x + 1$. $R$ is the base of a solid. Each cross section perpendicular to the x-axis is a square. Find the volume of the solid.
		$x^2 - 1 = x + 1 \implies x = \{2, -1\}$
		$\int_{-1}^{2} ((x + 1) - (x^2 - 1))^2 dx$
		$V=8.1$
	2. The region bounded by the graphs of $y = x^2 - 1$, $y = x + 1$, and the x-axis is the base of a solid. Each cross section perpendicular to the y-axis is a rectangle of height 4. Find the volume of the solid.
		$x^2 - 1 = x + 1 \implies x = \{2, -1\}$
		$\int_{-1}^{2} 4*((x + 1) - (x^2 - 1)) dx$
		$V =18$
