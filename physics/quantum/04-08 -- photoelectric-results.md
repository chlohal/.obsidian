$KE_{max} = 2.92 * 10^{-15} * x - 0.917$
> $0.917$ is the work function ($W_0$)-- the amount of energy you need to put in *before* you start seeing any KE being transfered to the electrons.
> $x$ is the frequency!

Since $KE_{max} = E_{light} - W_0$,  $E_{light} = h * freq$, where $h$ is Planck's Constant. 

Planck's Constant is:
*if using Joules*: $6.63 * 10^{-34}$ Js.
*if using Electron-Volts:* $4.14 * 10^{-16}$eVs.


## Conclusion

Light comes in chunks of energy: it is quantized. Its chunks, or packets, are called **photons**.
