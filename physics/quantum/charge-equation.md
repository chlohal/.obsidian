$$k = 9 * 10^{9}$$

A proton has $1.6 * 10^{-19}$C charge; an electron has $-1.6 * 10^{-19}$C.
$$F_E = \frac{k * q_1*q_2}{r^2}$$

An electron is on the outer part of a carbon atom $7 * 10^{-11}$m from the nucleus. How much force do the 6 protons in the nucleus put on the electron?

$F_E = \frac{k * 6e * -1e}{r^2}$
$F_E = \frac{9 * 10^{9} * 6 * 1.6 * 10^{-19} * -1.6 * 10^{-19}}{(7 * 10^{-11})^2}$
$F_E = \frac{9 * 10^{9} * 6 * 1.6 * 10^{-19} * -1.6 * 10^{-19}}{49 * 10^{-22}}$
$F_E = \frac{9 * 6 * 1.6 * 10^{-10} * -1.6 * 10^{-19}}{49 * 10^{-22}}$
$F_E = \frac{9 * 6 * 1.6 * 10^{-10} * -1.6 * 10^{-19} * 10^{22}}{49}$
$F_E = \frac{9 * 6 * 1.6 * 10^{-10} * -1.6 * 10^{3}}{49}$
$F_E = \frac{9 * 6 * 1.6 * -1.6 * 10^{-7}}{49}$
$F_E = -2.82122449 * 10^{-7}$N

### A field describes the **location**-- not the object there. There's only a force once a `thing` (e.g. charge, mass, etc) is there!

The direction of the Earth's gravitational field is **towards the Earth**, which is negative. 

The direction of the electic field is the direction that a positive charge would go, if placed in that field. If an item's field is negative, a positive charge would go towards it, but *a negative charge would go away*.

1) There is a location P that has an electric field value of $6 * 10^{-10}$N/C directed to the right.
	1) If an electron is placed at point P, how much force would be acting on it? In what direction? $1.6 * 10^{-19} * 6 * 10^{-10} = 9.6 10^{-29}$N to the left.
	2) If the electron were replaced with a helium nucleus (2 protons and 2 neutrons), what would the value of the electric field be at point P? Same location-- $6 * 10^{-10}$
	3) $3.2 * 10^{-19} * 6 * 10^{-10} = 19.2 10^{-29}$N to the right
2) In-between two parallel plates, there is an electric field of undetermined strength and direction.
	1) $5 * 10^{5}$N/C
	2) Upwards
	3) Negatively
	4) same field!
3)
