## Electric Potential Energy
Energy stored by the location in the field (like how gravity's potential energy is stored by height)

## Electric Potential Difference

AKA voltage. The location, and how "steep" of an electrical "hill" it's on.

Electric potential energy per coulomb of charge.

Voltage drop or gain -- electric potential difference.

Symbol: $\Delta V$
Unit: volt

| |Gravity|Electricity|
|-|-|-|
|Force (object)|$F = G m_1 m_2/r^2$|$F = k q_1 q_2 / r^2$|
|Field (location)|$g = F/m$; $F = mg$|$E = F/q$ $F=qE$|
|Potential energy (object)|$\Delta GPE = m g h$|$\Delta EPE = qEd$ d - distance|
|Potential difference (location)|$G_p = \Delta GPE /m$|$\Delta V = Ed$; $\Delta V = \Delta EPE / q$|


## Kinetic Energy Calculation

$E_K = 0.5mv^2$
