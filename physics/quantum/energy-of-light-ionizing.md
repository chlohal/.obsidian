It'd be really cool and helpful if the energy of the light was equal to the kinetic energy of the electrons it splits off. However, it needs to expend energy to "rip" electrons off of an atom, so there's some energy expended.

The **work function** ($W_0$) of a given substance is a function that determines the energy needed to knock off the most loosely bound electrons.
