## Magnetic Fields

Describes a location's ability to put a magetic force on a magnet. A moving charged particle will feel a force from a magnetic field.

Symbol: B
Unit: Tesla

*The strength of the Earth's magnetic field is 0.005T*

One place we get magnetic fields from is electrical current in a wire.

## Current

The flow of charge through a wire.

Symbol: I
Unit: Amp (A) -- coulomb/s

**The direction of current flow is the direction of positive charge flow. Electrons move one way, but we define current as a 'movement' the other way.** 

The amount of magentic field produced by a wire:

$B= \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$ 

$\mu_0$ is the **permeability of free space** ($4*10^{-7}$). $I$ is current. $r$ is the distance from the wire.

## The Right Hand Rule

1) Grab the wire with your right hand, your thumb pointing in the direction of **CONVENTIONAL** current flow
2) Your fingers will wrap around the wire in the direction of the $B$ field (magnetic field).

Convention about Drawing Arrows In/Out:

If you draw an arrow out of the page, draw a dot. If you draw an arrow into the page, draw an X.

1) A wire with 6.7A of current running through it is shown below. Determine the strength of the magnetic field 0.04m away from the wire.
	$B=\frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$
	$B=\frac{4*10^{-7} * 6.7}{2\pi 0.04}$
	$B=\frac{4\pi*10^{-7} * 6.7}{0.08\pi}$
	$B=\frac{\pi * 10^{-7} * 26.8}{0.08\pi}$
	$B=\frac{\pi * 10^{-7} * 335}{\pi}$
	$B=10^{-7} * 335$
	$B=10^{-5} * 3.35$T
2) $B=\frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$
	$B=\frac{4\pi*10^{-7} * 1.5}{2\pi 0.15}$ up
	$B=\frac{4 * 10^{-7} * 1.5}{2 * 0.15}$ up
	$B=\frac{4 * 10^{-7} * 1.5}{2 * 0.15}$ up
	$B=\frac{2 * 10^{-7} * 1.5}{0.15}$ up
	$B=\frac{10^{-7} * 3}{0.15}$ up
	$B=10^{-7} * 20$ up
	$B=2 * 10^{-6}$T up
