$B = \mu_0 (\frac{N}{l})I$

$\mu_0$: permeability of free space; $B= \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$ 
$N$: number of loops
$l$: length of the solenoid
$I$: current

## The Right Hand Rule 2

If you hold your right hand flat-handed, with your thumb up, you have 3 directions: the direction your **thumb** points, the direction your **fingers** point, and the direction your **palm** faces.

- The current ($I$-- the direction of a *positive charge*; the opposite of the electrons) goes towards your fingers.
- The field ($B$) direction goes out of your hand. 
- The force that the field puts on the electrons goes out of your thumb.

The force exerted by a magnetic field on a charge is:
$F = qvB$

where 
$F$: the force
$q$: the charge 
$v$: the velocity of the charge
$B$: the magnetic field
