As it goes through the bulbs, it loses voltage.

- A to B: 3.2
- C to D: 2.4 
- F to G: 3.2 (actual: 3.1)
- D to E: 0.8 (actual: 0.9)
- C to E: 3.2 (actual: 3.1)

Splitting is free in voltage; a measure of voltage will proceed along both wires equally. However, the sum of all voltage drops on a given current path must equal the sum of all voltage gains.
