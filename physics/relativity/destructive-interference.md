When waves are constructively interfering, they are said to be **in phase**.
When they're *de*structively interfering, they are said to be **out of phase**: completely opposite waves are **180 degrees out of phase**

Math Time
**d**: distance between slits
**$\lambda$**: Wavelength
**L**: distance between slits and screen
**x**: distance between bright spots

$x=\frac{\lambda L}{d}$
