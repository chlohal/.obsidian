# Light

## Demos

* Why can we see the orbee? It's not opaque-- light goes through it; it doesn't bounce off.
* You can see light from behind it, but it's not like a glass pane. You can see that it's there.
* It's the same thing as Mr. Corcoran's magnifying glass: when you look through it, it flips the visual upside-down.


### Demo: Orbees in Water
When we put the orbees into the water, **what changed?**
The light goes in straight instead of flipping upside-down. That makes the Orbee transparent and very hard to see.
Orbees are 95% water, so there's **essentially no medium change**. It's the change in *medium* that causes bending light.


But does light bend when it's air-water-air?
### Demo: Laser in Water

The laser beam light bends when it's going through *at an angle*. It does not bend when going through perpendicularly.

## Notes

Light bends when it enters a new medium. This is known as **refraction**.
We see refraction through lenses. When going through lenses, light goes upside-down, because each ray is refracted at an inverse angle.

### Snell's Law
$n_1 sin(\theta_2) = n_2 sin(\theta_2)$
$n$ - index of refraction. IOR is a constant for each medium, equal to $c_{medium}/c_{vaccum}$. A vaccum has an IOR of $1$. 
$\theta$ - angle measured from normal (vertical on most graphs)
