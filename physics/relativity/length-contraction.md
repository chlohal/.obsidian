$L = \frac{L_0}{\gamma}$

The $L_0$ is the "proper length". It's measured by an observer at rest relative to the object. It is the *longest possible length* for an object.

$L$ is the contracted length. It's measured by a reference frame that's moving relative to the object.


Anna's ship is measured by Bob to be 12m long as she flies by him at 2.6\*10^8m/s. How long does Anna measure it to be?

$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$
$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2.6^2}{3^2}}}$
$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.751111112}}$
$\gamma = \frac{1}{0.5}$
$\gamma = 2$

$12 = \frac{L_0}{2}$
$24 = L_0$

	A meter stick is shot past you at .95c. How long do you measure it to be?

	$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$
	$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{0.95^2}{1^2}}}$
	$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.95^2}}$
	$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9025}}$
	$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0975}}$
	$\gamma = \frac{1}{0.3122499}$
	$\gamma = \frac{1}{0.3122499}$
	$\gamma = 3.20256308$

	0.3122499 meters.

	$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$
	$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{0.6^2}{c^2}}}$
	$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}}$
	$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}}$
	$\gamma = \frac{1}{0.8}$
	$\gamma = 1.25$
	
	$L = \frac{50}{\gamma}$
	$L = \frac{50}{1.25}$
	$L = 40$

	$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$
	$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{0.9^2}{c^2}}}$
	$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.81}}$
	$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.19}}$
	$\gamma = \frac{1}{0.435889894}$
	$\gamma < 2$
	No, since the jet is not contracted by more than 50%.
